- THRONE OF THE DIVINE SEAL -
- ASTRAL CHART OF FATE -

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,030
(Previously) The Abyss is divided into the outer layer,

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,070
the inner layer, and the core.

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,750
The deeper you go,

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,160
the more dangerous it gets.

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,110
At the deepest point,

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,150
even light cannot escape.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,560
Senior Ye,

30
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,430
I’ve learned many lessons,

31
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,870
but none of them say

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,270
to just watch a hero die.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,150
Drag everyone
Dragon Haochen cares about

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,990
into this mess.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,470
I’ll push this death match
to its peak.

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,790
I want Dragon Haochen to fall into utter despair.

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,180
EPISODE 185
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,820
You’ve revived the glory
of God Juling Shen.

39
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,300
You’ve made the bloodline of Juling Shen boil once again.

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,020
But in history,

41
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,900
descendants of Juling Shen
like you

42
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,580
all die suddenly
one night.

43
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,180
They just drop dead.

44
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,940
This is

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,240
the curse of the gods.

46
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,700
(Burning through hell)

47
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,700
Where is this?

48
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,260
What’s going on?

49
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,980
So many demons
showed up suddenly.

50
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,540
The weakest are
seventh rank.

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,180
We’re only
fourth or fifth rank.

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,380
There are many civilians
with no fighting power.

53
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,620
We must protect them.

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,220
What are these darn demons
trying to do?

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,420
Dragging so many civilians
into the chaos.

56
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,640
Darn it.

57
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,700
They’re clearly
toying with us.

58
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,260
Brothers, devour them!

59
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,820
Win this for
His Highness the Prince!

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,360
Warriors, protect the civilians!

61
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,680
Little Cake!

62
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,780
It’s Hall Master Wang
from the Warrior Temple!

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,980
We’re saved!

64
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,140
Take her out first!

65
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,940
Darn humans!

66
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,260
You’ll all die sooner or later.

67
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,340
You talk too much.

68
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,020
Demons—

69
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,180
are all dead!

70
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,620
We won!

71
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,470
Humans are victorious!

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,260
That’s great!

73
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,100
Wait, no—

74
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,700
There’s still one left.

75
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,780
Hall Master Wang!

76
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,220
Be careful!

77
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,900
It’s the Demon God!

78
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,140
Crush these despicable humans!

79
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,220
(So strong…)

80
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,540
Hall Master!

81
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,940
What a terrifying aura…

82
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,620
Which Demon God is that?

83
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,540
That…

84
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,220
That must be the Fifth Pillar
Hell Demon God—

85
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,980
Marbas.

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,660
Hell Demon God.

87
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,140
How come I’ve never seen him?

88
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,100
According to the Alliance records,

89
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,940
the last time he appeared was thousands of years ago.

90
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,700
He’s been hidden
for so long.

91
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,540
His power

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,060
is probably unfathomable.

93
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,780
At first, Marbas was just an ordinary demon.

94
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,700
He looked completely average, nothing special at all.

95
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,340
But with one move, he killed the Seventy-Second Pillar Demon God.

96
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,180
He rose to the rank of Demon God.

97
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,940
Then,

98
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,140
he became a hellish asura,

99
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,020
slaughtering his way from
the Seventy-Second Pillar

100
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,060
all the way to the Fifth Pillar.

101
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,140
He pierced the heart of the
Fifth Pillar Demon God.

102
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,300
He shattered the Demon God Crown
of the Fifth Pillar.

103
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,740
From then on,

104
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,260
he became the new Hell Demon God.

105
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,660
Though competition among Demon Gods
is always fierce,

106
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,340
his rise still shook the demon race.

107
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,980
To calm the demons,

108
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,660
His Majesty ordered me
to imprison him.

109
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,980
Until now.

110
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,340
He must be enjoying

111
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,620
this long-lost freedom.

112
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,060
(Fifth Pillar Hell Demon God: Marbas)

113
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,300
That was a heavy blow.

114
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,650
Next.

115
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,790
Dad…

116
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,940
You’d better last a bit longer.

117
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,260
Who said you could touch them?

118
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,220
You’re really annoying me.

119
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,220
You actually survived one of my attacks.

120
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,020
Interesting.

121
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,420
It's been so long since I last killed.

122
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,740
You'd better make this fun for me.

123
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,460
What is this?

124
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,180
Welcome to

125
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,260
Slaughter Hell.

126
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,380
(Domain: Slaughter Hell)

127
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,020
I'll give you the highest level of hospitality.

128
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,700
What does he want with Yuanyuan?

129
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,100
He's suppressing his own rank.

130
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,960
Sealing part of his power.

131
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,940
The demon god wants to torture his prey.

132
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,780
Let's play a little longer.

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,580
Don't waste my kindness.

134
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,180
He actually lowered his rank to match my ninth rank, second level.

135
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,580
If you can hurt me, you win.

136
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,740
Come.

137
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,980
Blood Saw Frenzy!

138
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,700
How is this possible?

139
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,900
At the same rank,

140
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,700
his power is still many times mine.

141
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,500
Come on,

142
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,300
little warrior.

143
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,240
Not bad.

144
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,660
You've got strength.

145
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,060
My turn now.

146
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,380
Run faster!

147
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,100
Got you!

148
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Little warrior.

149
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,060
(So strong.)

150
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,100
(Until now,)

151
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,540
(he hasn't even used a skill.)

152
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,860
Blood Domain!

153
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,060
Activate!

154
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,620
Yuanyuan's Blood Domain has been broken.

155
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,880
And with just one move.

156
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,300
Is that all you've got?

157
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,340
Aegis of Juling Shen!

158
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,360
Aegis of Juling Shen!

159
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,220
Could it be you're a descendant of Ju Ling Shen?

160
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,600
This is getting interesting.

161
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,480
No wonder you survived my attack.

162
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,580
Ju Ling Divine Weapon!

163
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,420
Sever the Void!

164
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,980
It worked!

165
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,740
Such a nostalgic move.

166
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,620
Ju Ling Divine Weapon!

167
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,380
Sever the Void!

168
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,300
What?

169
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,500
Why does he

170
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,740
know that move?

171
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,340
Three thousand years ago,

172
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,820
the first to awaken Ju Ling Shen's bloodline was burned alive.

173
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,460
The second awakened

174
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,100
froze to death in a blizzard.

175
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,240
The third, every bone in his body was shattered.

176
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
He couldn't even crawl.

177
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,740
Just like

178
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,660
this punch.

179
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,220
On his body,

180
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,460
why is there Ju Ling Shen's power?

181
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,100
Aegis of Juling Shen!

182
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
It's broken.

183
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,620
Three thousand years ago, I first tasted Ju Ling Shen's power.

184
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,140
So sweet.

185
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,460
So powerful.

186
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,540
With that power, I became the Fifth Pillar Demon God.

187
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,420
To devour all Ju Ling Shen's power,

188
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,740
I waited patiently.

189
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,260
Cursing in hell every awakened Ju Ling Shen descendant.

190
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,700
So the one killing Ju Ling Shen's bloodline

191
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,540
is you.

192
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,580
(Ju Ling Shen)

193
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,220
Now,

194
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,300
you're the last one.

195
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,380
(Hell Ju Ling Shen)

196
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,740
Once I kill you,

197
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,420
I'll have all Ju Ling Shen's power.

198
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,580
With this power, I'll remake myself completely.

199
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,780
Become greater than a demon god.

200
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,020
Surpass the Demon God Emperor Feng Xiu.

201
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,740
What's happening?

202
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,700
Our Furious Battle Force—

203
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,060
The Furious Battle Force from Lord Wang—

204
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,100
He's using Yuanyuan

205
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,820
to extract all Ju Ling Shen's power.

206
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,510
Finally,

207
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,540
the last of Ju Ling Shen's power

208
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,500
is mine too.

209
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,660
I've finally become

210
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,300
the complete Ju Ling Shen.

211
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,020
Yuanyuan...

212
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,700
The demons

213
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,220
are about to win again.

214
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,940
Our bloody goddess of war

215
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,420
is she going to lose?

216
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,430
Ju Ling Shen...

217
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,700
Yuanyuan...

218
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,150
We of the Warrior Temple are all ordinary people without talent.

219
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,620
Except for hard work and blood, the only thing we rely on

220
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
is our faith in Ju Ling Shen.

221
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,940
You carry his bloodline.

222
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,180
You're our most vital spark.

223
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,220
You must restore Ju Ling Shen's glory.

224
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,700
Restore the glory of warriors.

225
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,760
This bloodline made me lonely,

226
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,130
but also proud.

227
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,540
But now,

228
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,090
I grieve for this bloodline.

229
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,140
And rage.

230
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,460
The so-called divine curse—

231
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,160
the truth is laughable.

232
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:45,984
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

233
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,260
Just a greedy thief.

234
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,980
You

235
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,300
are not worthy of Ju Ling Shen.

236
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,860
Let me tell you—Ju Ling Shen

237
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,460
is not my greatest power.

238
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,180
It's not about bloodline, not about anything else.

239
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,700
It's just a heart that fights

240
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,900
to the very end.

241
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,390
What?

242
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,100
Ju Ling...

243
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,540
Ten Thousand Bloods to Ashes!

244
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,500
(Ten Thousand Bloods to Ashes)

245
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,460
Why is this fire burning me?

246
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,900
With the descendant's final forbidden art,

247
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,340
I ignite Ju Ling Shen's bloodline within me.

248
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,660
The flames from this bloodline

249
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,980
will ignite all Ju Ling Shen's power in the world.

250
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,980
You will be burned by the Ju Ling Shen power

251
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,220
inside you until nothing remains.

252
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,100
Darn it.

253
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,740
But a mere mortal like you can only burn for a few moments.

254
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
I am

255
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,060
the mighty Fifth Pillar Demon God.

256
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,500
Hell Demon God.

257
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,180
He unleashed all his power.

258
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,980
Returned to his original rank: ninth tier, level seven.

259
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,160
Yuanyuan.

260
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,860
Until you burn to ashes, I will still stand here.

261
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,060
You are nothing but a tiny kindling.

262
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,580
How could you ignite the whole night?

263
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,860
How long can you endure this pain?

264
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,700
It truly hurts.

265
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,420
I am just kindling too.

266
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,540
But our captain once told me,

267
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,020
Yuanyuan,

268
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,020
you have never fought alone.

269
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,460
Behind you,

270
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,060
countless warriors stand.

271
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,380
The faith you have always held

272
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,060
is also their faith.

273
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,540
They all believe in you deeply.

274
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,100
Believe in us.

275
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,900
Believe in all humanity.

276
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,860
We will surely achieve victory.

277
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,060
So,

278
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,700
even if I am just kindling,

279
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,700
the passion that belongs

280
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,100
to humanity,

281
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,100
our faith and will,

282
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,820
warriors, as long as our belief endures,

283
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,780
Temple Master Wang will not fall.

284
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,980
Humanity will not fall.

285
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,820
Humanity will not fall.

286
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,820
Humanity will not fall.

287
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,540
Yuanyuan will not fall.

288
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,420
This willpower

289
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,180
lets me burn

290
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,500
and grow at the same time.

291
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,100
H-how is this possible?

292
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,340
You're insane!

293
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,460
This is the world's most agonizing punishment.

294
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,220
You will, for all eternity, every single moment, suffer the pain of burning flames.

295
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,100
It cannot be reversed.

296
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,620
There is no escape.

297
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,740
Then let these flames burn through hell,

298
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,300
and consume everything.

299
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,940
From now on,

300
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,460
my God Juling Shen bloodline

301
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,660
will be ruled by me alone.

302
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,220
Like this,

303
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,460
it's not so bad.

304
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620

(this clan will endure forever.)

315
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,710
Loser.

316
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,740
You even dreamed of surpassing Father Emperor, but your own greed burned you to nothing.

317
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,780
Seems it's not this fate star.

318
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,140
So who will die

319
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,580
next?

320
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,560
I failed to kill you last time.

321

This time,

322
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,620
I will rip out your bones and dig out your heart.

323

With your flesh and blood,

324
