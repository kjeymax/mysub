(These three can become my main force.)

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,660
Young,

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,800
I've found King Tienson's coordinates.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,060
King Bladeriver!

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,530
I knew it was you.

34
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,140
King Tienson.

35
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,490
Master.

36
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,360
King Bladeriver is no longer in the system.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,720
King Bladeriver risked his life to save me,

38
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,590
and you dare plot against his treasures!?

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,670
Die!

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,510
Good.

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,490
(You dare covet the treasure
with such meager power?)

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,740
Shining Moon Strike!

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,270
King Bladeriver!

44
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,910
(King Sevenswords!)

45
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,950
Episode 199
[Starry Tower]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

46
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,770
King Sevenswords,

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,420
your sword seems slower.

48
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,770
King Sevenswords's sword force is unmatched,

49
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,350
completely overwhelming King Bladeriver.

50
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,930
But in terms of speed,

51
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,400
he isn't losing at all.

52
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,980
He attacks from long range,

53
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,750
even if King Sevenswords gets serious,

54
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,000
he can't do anything about him.

55
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,570
(Once we really go all out,)

56
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,930
(eight stars can only barely affect
his sword speed.)

57
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,830
(Seems I'm still not on his level.)

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,590
You truly are formidable.

59
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,430
Impressive.

60
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,280
I'll be taking my leave first.

61
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,880
You think you can come after me?

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,010
How ridiculous.

63
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,760
King Bladeriver,

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,760
I will come back for revenge.

65
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,500
Such astonishing speed,

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,330
and formidable strength.

67
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,780
He made me use five swords.

68
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,930
His power is enough

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,080
to be worthy of a heavy treasure.

70
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,560
He actually acknowledged his strength.

71
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,870
That's terrifying.

72
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,440
With that speed, who could compare?

73
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,100
We'd better not provoke him in the future.

74
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,610
("Better to meet Sevenswords and die,
than meet Bladeriver.")

75
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,810
(This saying spreads widely.)

76
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Come on.

77
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,590
Is he really that strong?

78
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,960
When we see him, we all need to step aside.

79
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,670
Feels like he's even scarier
than King Sevenswords.

80
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,630
Be careful.

81
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,230
- Don't provoke him.
- This...

82
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,600
("Better to meet the Seven Swords and die,)

83
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,850
(than meet the Blade River."
The rumor spreads everywhere.)

84
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,900
(I knew you weren't simple.)

85
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,910
(King Bladeriver's deeds spread rapidly
across the outer battlefield.)

86
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,370
(But no matter how wildly it spreads,)

87
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,930
(I've already returned to my identity.)

88
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,080
(I'll continue cultivating quietly.)

89
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,390
(I'll first pass the Realm-lord-level
Original Sky Mountain.)

90
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,050
(Once I pass,)

91
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,370
(I can enter the Hone Alliance
under my own name.)

92
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,520
(Next,)

93
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,240
(I'll challenge Sky Bridge, level 20.)

94
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
(It's said that those who pass level 20,)

95
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,450
(their comprehension of laws can rival
an Invincible King.)

96
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,290
(So I want to see)

97
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,860
(what happens if I challenge it)

98
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,970
(as a realm lord.)

99
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,250
(Sky Bridge; King Derivative: Level 20)

100
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,480
(Luo Feng: Level 20)

101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,750
(Bran: Level 18)
He just passed Sky Mountain,

102
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,380
and now he's already reached level 20
of Sky Bridge,

103
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,130
(King Derivative, Luo Feng)
(at the same level as his teacher.)

104
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,470
I thought entering the Original Space

105
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,730
would let me close the distance.

106
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,930
Didn't expect the gap grew even larger.

107
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,660
To surpass the past self

108
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,660
is to live up to the effort you once made.

109
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,990
Let's keep going together.

110
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,280
Chaos City Lord sent a mail saying

111
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,630
you can officially enter the Hone Alliance
as Luo Feng.

112
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,350
However,

113
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,660
he repeatedly warned:

114
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,350
you must not reveal that you're
King Bladeriver.

115
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,250
(The Hone Alliance won't let)

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,160
(anything about your secret leak.)

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,150
(Do NOT reveal that you're Bladeriver.)

118
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,700
My teacher is indeed thorough.

119
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,960
Once my identity is exposed,

120
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,700
the other races will likely see me as a threat

121
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,890
and spend enormous resources to assassinate me.

122
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,860
Teacher Zoranco provided me

123
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,010
(Enfa Realm, Goofan Realm. Uhoa Realm)
with three metal plate coordinates.

124
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,850
(Goofan Realm)
One of them can be accessed at my stage.

125
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,440
To avoid ending up passive against other races,

126
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,550
gathering the third metal plate

127
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,620
must now be put on the agenda.

128
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,910
(Xu Xin)

129
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,660
(The family banquet is arranged.)
But before that,

130
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,060
(I'm waiting for you.)
I need to return to Earth first.

131
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,830
There's an immigrant ship approaching.

132
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,330
This is Earth.

133
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,050
Identify yourselves, outsiders.

134
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,940
Master,

135
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,050
how could they not recognize you,
the lord of Earth?

136
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,390
Dad, look.

137
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,430
Those immigrants are completely out of control.

138
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,080
(Walk toward a new shore.)
Last time I returned,

139
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,380
they detained me for half a day under
the excuse of "identity verification."

140
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
Clearly just trying to put me in my place.

141
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Stop. Don't add trouble for Dad.

142
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,500
Who gave you the right?

143
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,510
Listen,

144
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,220
Earth's defense control

145
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,590
has been taken over by
the Immigrant Headquarters.

146
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,660
(The agreement clearly stated that)

147
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,150
(Sovereignty Division Agreement)
(Earthlings would retain half the control.)

148
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,720
(I didn't expect that in the six thousand years
I was gone,)

149
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,820
(power would be eroded this much.)

150
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,930
Get lost!

151
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,870
Lord Luo Feng!

152
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,850
- Swallowed Star -
- Starry Tower -

153
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you doing?

154
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,360
Why are you kicking us out?

155
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,050
You have no right to drive us away!

156
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,260
You're just bullying us!

157
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,650
This area is temporarily requisitioned.

158
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,980
(Fully open, building an immigrant homeland.)

159
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Luo Feng.

160
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,480
I've been away too long,

161
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,280
that's why immigrants are doing this.

162
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,790
I know the Immigration Authority can see this.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
Remember,

164
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,730
your jurisdiction

165
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,950
is limited to the oceans.

166
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,000
As for the continents of Earth,

167
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,920
don't even think about touching them.

168
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,850
Luo Feng is getting way too arrogant.

169
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,220
He doesn't take us seriously at all.

170
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,990
Master, don't be angry.

171
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,200
He is the disciple of the Chaos City Lord.

172
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,640
Before, when he was away,

173
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,530
we could still act freely.

174
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,050
But now,

175
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,430
we must restrain ourselves.

176
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,240
So what?

177
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
Most immigrants to Earth

178
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,450
are elites from the Five Major Human Factions,

179
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,340
including the descendants of Cosmic Lords.

180
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,570
No matter how capable he is,

181
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,650
he can't shake our foundation.

182
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,130
This aura...

183
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,480
Even I, as an Immortal King, can feel fear.

184
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,500
This is...

185
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,130
What is that?

186
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,350
An Immortal Star-Eater Vine.

187
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,370
Its power

188
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,590
is likely no weaker than a limit King.

189
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,180
From this moment on,

190
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,690
all immigrants and Earth's native residents

191
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,520
are forbidden from stepping into
each other's territories.

192
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,730
Those still lingering
in the other side's domain

193
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,020
must leave within twelve cosmic hours.

194
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
Anyone who violates this

195
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,690
will be killed on sight.

196
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,310
Great!

197
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,120
Great!

198
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,050
Luo Feng!

199
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,180
Don't let him escape!

200
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,460
(A restriction on both sides,)

201
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,940
(but in practice, aimed at immigrants.)

202
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,730
He's bluffing.

203
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,260
He has no authority over
the Immigration Authority.

204
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,750
He doesn't,

205
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,830
but the Chaos City Lord does.

206
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,160
(Effective immediately.)

207
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,150
This is a decree just issued
by the Chaos City Lord.

208
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,380
(All immigrants are forbidden
from entering continent regions.)

209
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,050
(Meanwhile, Earth's original residents)

210
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,780
(are strictly forbidden from
stepping into ocean regions.)

211
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,110
(Anyone violating this law)

212
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,210
(shall be executed.)

213
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,400
Chaos... Chaos...

214
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,060
And what can you do?

215
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,580
I don't believe he'd really take things
this far.

216
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,600
Be careful.

217
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,190
Don't cross the boundary,

218
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,140
or your end

219
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,630
will be just like these
who resisted enforcement.

220
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,490
Even if you two are senior officials,

221
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,630
you are no exception.

222
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,990
Luo Feng, you...

223
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,810
This is a threat to all immigrants! You...

224
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,190
Would you rather die to the Star-Eater Vine,

225
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,650
or die at my subordinate's hands?

226
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,630
If not,

227
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,750
then leave.

228
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,610
Lord Luo Feng,

229
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,290
King Interception spoke out of turn.

230
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,130
Please forgive him.

231
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,610
We will leave at once.

232
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,380
(Effective immediately.)

233
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,750
(Chaos City Lord)

234
00:15:29,774 --> 00:16:04,874
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

235
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,530
(With the Star-Eater Vine present,)

236
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,080
(the immigrants no longer dare invade
Earth's territory.)

237
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,890
(I can now leave Earth with peace of mind.)

238
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,360
This biological spaceship confiscated
in the Starry Tower

239
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,940
is better for hiding my identity.

240
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,980
And it can reach up to eighty times
light-speed.

241
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,420
It'll get me to the metal plate's location
much faster.

242
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,670
Even the Almen ship

243
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,130
can be retired now.

244
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,700
I have never forgotten the legacy

245
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,260
Teacher Huyan Bo left me.

246
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
And now,

247
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,420
with the inheritance and treasures
I've obtained,

248
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,460
I'm much more confident

249
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,480
in avenging him.

250
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,970
I can postpone the metal plate search for now.

251
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,380
Tell me

252
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,530
who killed

253
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,040
Teacher Huyan Bo?

254
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,310
(Planet Magshow)

255
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,620
If I hadn't requested you from King Blooddemon,

256
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,410
you'd already be dead as test subjects.

257
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,310
(King Magshow) Give me a smile as repayment,

258
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,530
that's not too much to ask, right?

259
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,020
This is the sound.

260
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,850
Louder.

261
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,560
King Magshow,

262
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,860
tormenting your servants at will?

263
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,270
What a mighty king.

264
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,300
My lord,

265
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,380
we've never met before.

266
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,200
I don't know how I have offended you.

267
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,170
Please, enlighten me.

268
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,580
(King Sevenswords. Front, Back)

269
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,660
(Emerged from Giant Axe at a young age,)

270
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
(he became a disciple of a Cosmic Lord.)

271
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,890
(Soon, he was near invincible King level.)

272
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,210
(As a human genius, he's feared
by other races.)

273
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,290
(Floating City, a settlement built)

274
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,150
(above Earth's oceans.)

275
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,000
(They are massive and luxurious,)

276
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,850
(inhabited by alien talents.)

277
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,860
(In name, they are harmless.)

278
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,390
(Q: What is the "infant universe"?)

279
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,220
(A: It refers to the extremely early state
of the universe)

280
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,570
(right after the Big Bang, during
a short period.)

281
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,280
(It describes how the universe expanded
from a super-hot,)

282
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,870
(high-density state, cooled down,)

283
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,080
(and gradually formed the cosmos
we know today.)
