00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,199
[Previously]
Rumors all say Blade River King is Luo Feng.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,099
Finally something to boast about.

3
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,966
This is the legendary Ancestral God Secret Region.

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,766
Five-Colored Aurora Lake...

5
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:19,866
up to ten light-years wide...

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,332
power boundless.

7
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:22,899
From this moment...

8
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,699
you two are inheritors of Purple Thorn Island.

9
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:28,032
Disrespecting you...

10
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,299
would be an insult to me.

11
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:33,266
This Ancestral God Cult virtual space...

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,766
is nothing compared to the Virtual Universe.

13
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:36,767
is nothing compared to the Virtual Universe.

Episode 205 
[Ancestral God Contract Arc]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

15
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,499
They all believe I'm Blade River King...

16
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,299
then Blade River it is.

17
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,233
Blade River King!

18
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:56,632
The legendary Blade River King!

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Blade River King!

20
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,499
That very Blade River King!

21
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,532
Glory World Rankings...

22
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,532
my spot is here.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,566
Inheritors of different levels...

24
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,532
are ranked on separate lists.

25
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:12,833
Seventh highest...

26
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:14,633
Seven Sword King.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,466
Ranked by wins and losses.

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,332
Victories earn Glory Points.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,632
One hundred points exchange
for an extra inheritance chance.

30
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:27,566
Our earlier battle...

31
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:28,767
was truly exhilarating.

32
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:30,932
Let's spar more in the future.

33
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,499
Millions of inheritors in the plaza...

34
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:37,599
yet Hong Alliance side...

35
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,232
has only over a thousand.

36
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,666
Over here!

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
That's him!

38
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,799
Blade River King is riding high now.

39
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:48,899
Machine and Demon races
have open bounties.

40
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,032
Beat him senseless...

41
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,666
and fame will soar.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,866
That Seven Sword King group...

43
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,266
is the Northern Border Alliance.

44
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,332
Just weak races banded together...

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,032
not as strong as our Hong Alliance.

46
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,066
But inheritance tokens are scattered
across the universe...

47
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,632
many races, vast territories...

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,199
so more come here.

49
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,632
Northern Border loves to gossip.

50
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:17,466
Ignore them.

51
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,799
Glory Points are precious...

52
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:20,132
everyone's cautious...

53
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,532
rarely issuing challenges.

54
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,799
Out of jealousy...

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,566
they provoke others
to reject human challenges.

56
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,199
So annoying.

57
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,699
What are you looking at?

58
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,932
I got tons of challenge letters.

59
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:38,532
Your fame is just too big...

60
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,266
plenty of unconvinced geniuses.

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,732
You'll get thousands, probably.

62
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,532
Over sixty thousand already.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,599
What?!

64
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,799
Blade River King, a mere World Lord...

65
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,399
relying only on law comprehension
and secret arts...

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,366
can't possibly kill Peak Kings.

67
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,367
Yeah...

68
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,699
Must have treasures or rare encounters.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But...

70
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,699
in Glory World battles...

71
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,299
everyone uses equal divine bodies...

72
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,766
weapons and gear chosen only here.

73
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:13,366
His treasures are useless.

74
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,532
Challenge!

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,499
I'll thrash the legendary Blade River King!

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Be careful...

77
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,766
no backing out once accepted.

78
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,632
They're peerless geniuses from all races...

79
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,932
most created peak secret arts...

80
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,866
some even ultimate arts.

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,299
Lose...

82
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,099
and wait an era for new Glory Points.

83
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,132
Ultimate arts?

84
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,066
My self-created peak arts...

85
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,099
already earned Chaos City Lord's praise.

86
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,132
Blade River King...

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,166
I...

88
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,566
Pa E Ka Fen Si King challenges you!

89
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,066
Dare you accept?

90
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,699
Such big fame...

91
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,832
just from lucky encounters, right?

92
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:49,932
Blade River King...

93
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,599
Got the guts? Bet three Glory Points!

94
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:58,199
Blade River King!

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,866
Hilarious!

96
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,666
That new human actually accepted...

97
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,566
over six hundred twenty thousand challenges!

98
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,899
Never happened on Purple Thorn Island before.

99
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,032
Such a powerful divine body—perfect!

100
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,999
Before becoming Immortal...

101
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:43,199
I can fight with a body
at 100,000 times World Lord power!

102
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:55,599
Blade River King!

103
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:38,732
What?!

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,732
You actually lost
to that Blade River King?

105
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,866
He's just a World Lord
without treasures!

106
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,066
Pathetic!

107
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,032
Let me take him on.

108
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:53,599
Warm-up complete.

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,066
Next battle...

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,699
Die!

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,699
Another Glory Point delivery.

112
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,399
Damn it...
I'll lose points to him too!

113
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,499
Without external aids...

114
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,499
a World Lord atop
third-level inheritors...

115
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:21,366
I'm convinced.

116
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:21,866
I'm convinced.

117
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,866
Never thought he'd reach this level.

118
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:30,699
The Ancestral God Cult
is forging a supreme powerhouse for humanity.

119
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,267
But...

120
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,566
assassinations against Luo Feng...

121
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,466
will only grow more frenzied.

122
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,499
Blade River King cannot live.

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,466
If he becomes a Universe Venerable...

124
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,466
he'll wield Universe Overlord strength.

125
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,366
A greater threat than
an unrevivable Overlord.

126
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,799
Our Demon vassal races...

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,966
who's receiving inheritance here?

128
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:52,932
Venerable Marsh Erosion...

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,999
currently fifth-level inheritor.

130
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,499
Our Prison Race is remote...

131
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,766
let's watch from the sidelines.

132
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,566
The four core pinnacle races...

133
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,399
will put on a fine show.

134
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,866
Add Blade River King
to humanity's priority kill list.

135
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,232
Pick the right moment...

136
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,166
As you command.

137
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Father God...

138
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,366
Eliminate human Blade River King at once!

139
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,367
Yes.

140
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,366
Kong Wan and Jue Guang
pay respects to Insect Empress.

141
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,832
Across our Insect Alliance...

142
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,299
you're the best fit, Jue Guang.

143
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,132
Kong Wan excels at soul control.

144
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,532
Losses from Aurora Lake annihilation...

145
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,299
the Alliance will compensate
upon revival.

146
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,332
Best to soul-enslave Blade River King...

147
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:03,166
cutting off humanity's revival chance.

148
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,899
If not, kill him outright.

149
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:31,023
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

150
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,599
It's over.

151
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,299
Your Glory Points exceed 610,000.

152
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,632
One hundred points
for one precious inheritance chance.

153
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,866
Quite a harvest.

154
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,899
Why hasn't he emerged?

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,299
That cowardly human!

156
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,232
While studying Beast God Path...

157
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,099
those 620,000 battles honed me.

158
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,333
Now...

159
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,299
my Beast God Path nears third stage perfection.

160
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,699
Space law comprehension rises too.

161
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:55,066
Earthling and Golden Horned Beast
can now teleport.

162
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,499
But space lockdown and strangulation...

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,666
need more study.

164
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,066
Time for the next Beast God inheritance.

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,332
Sacrificing a Universe Venerable...

166
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,966
just for one World Lord.

167
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,632
You should be proud.

168
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
So fast!

169
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,766
Demon camp's Venerable Marsh Erosion.

170
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,366
I'll observe first.

171
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,966
Enslave me?

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Dream on!

173
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,532
What?!

174
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:41,032
His soul defense is this strong?!

175
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,199
Then...

176
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,032
die!

177
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:09,567
This...

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,999
Marsh Erosion and Luo Feng's auras!

179
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,632
Venerable Marsh Erosion attacked Blade River King...

180
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:30,999
and was slain.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,399
Blade River King's body
is completely destroyed.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,499
Those wings of Blade River King...

183
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,932
priceless supreme treasure!

184
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:46,966
Ancestral God Cult decree...

185
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,199
forbids looting among inheritors.

186
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,732
Blade River King is dead...

187
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,566
it's ownerless now.

188
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,132
The ban should lapse.

189
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,966
How?!

190
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,899
The treasure flew inside!

191
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,167
Impossible!

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,466
Blade River King lives!

193
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,666
Y-yes, Island Lord!

194
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,066
Venerable Marsh Erosion violated the ban...

195
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,266
Island Lord...

196
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,932
assassinating an inheritor
on sacred grounds...

197
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:10,166
even if revived through time reversal...

198
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,099
the Ancestral God Cult
will hunt him relentlessly...

199
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,666
until death.

200
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,299
Island Lord...

201
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
How is this possible?!

202
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,466
He looks completely unharmed...

203
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,899
Could he have the legendary
clone talent?

204
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,466
Blade River King lives!

205
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:53,699
Disperse, all of you.

206
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:58,466
Blade River King is an inheritor
of our Ancestral God Cult.

207
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,966
Assassinate him...

208
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,066
and face annihilation
from the Ancestral God Cult.

209
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,666
Never seen the Cult
value an inheritor this much.

210
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,666
Killing Luo Feng here...

211
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,299
will be near impossible.

212
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,466

214

[Q: What is a cosmic bubble?]

215
