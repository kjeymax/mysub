00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,180
I made it.

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,890
I often sit on the mountain peak,

36

Episode 197
[Starry Tower]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

39
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,780
I have prepared two supreme treasures for you.

40
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,760
The Starry Tower is one of them.

41
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,340
And the other is called

42
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,480
the Raid Armor.

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,020
Although you have not seen it,

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,290
you have already had some connection with it.

45
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,300
The Raid Armor is the personal battle armor
Teacher forged for you.

46
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,310
It possesses the ability to birth
offspring armor forms.

47
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,130
The Soldier Armor, General Armor, King Armor,
and even

48
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,840
the higher-level Emperor Armor
you've encountered

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,850
are all offspring born from the Raid Armor.

50
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,420
It is a treasure coveted even by Cosmic Lords.

51
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,000
(So I had already contacted offspring
of the Raid Armor.)

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
(Perhaps the reason I could obtain the Soldier,
General, and King Armors)

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,120
(was not pure coincidence.)

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,360
With such generosity from Teacher,

55
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,870
Luo Feng,

56
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,660
do you have anything to say?

57
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,400
Thank you for your guidance, Teacher.

58
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,870
But to activate it requires the power
of a hundred million–fold Realm Lord.

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,350
With your current strength, you still
cannot use it.

60
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,360
For now, I will store it with
the Flame God Race,

61
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,650
and your Second Senior Brother
will safeguard it temporarily.

62
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,120
Do not worry.

63
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,110
I have also prepared a treasure
that you can use right now.

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,930
The "Original Soul."

65
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,230
I gave it to your Second Senior Brother
earlier.

66
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,180
It is also capable of producing offspring.

67
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,330
These are

68
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,630
cosmic strings linking different dimensions?

69
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,800
What you are seeing

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,170
are the Soldier, General, King, and Emperor
Souls born from the Original Soul—

71
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,470
a supreme treasure for cultivating the soul.

72
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,260
It will greatly benefit the Earth lineage.

73
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,750
The Earth lineage?

74
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,940
The Flame God Race is born with
extraordinary talent.

75
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,640
They are natural-born warriors.

76
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,870
Your Second Senior Brother, Emperor Flame,
is among the best.

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,850
But in terms of soul power,
they are rather ordinary.

78
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,920
To make up for this flaw,

79
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,610
Teacher created the Earth lineage.

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,760
(So the Earth lineage)

81
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,360
(was created for this purpose.)

82
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,690
Emperor Flame already has the Original Soul's
main body.

83
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,880
Of the remaining million offspring souls,

84
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,580
you may take a portion.

85
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,930
The rest will be

86
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,730
supplied to the Earth lineage.

87
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,120
In the future,

88
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,180
when you become a supreme powerhouse,

89
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,230
under your protection and guidance,

90
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,930
they will naturally grow into a mighty race.

91
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,090
With this mission,

92
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,710
I'll put in all my effort.

93
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,910
Aside from these,

94
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,230
there is one final treasure.

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,310
Come with me.

96
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,190
Go.

97
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,730
(This speed clearly surpasses light-speed,)

98
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,720
(yet we haven't entered the Dark Universe.)

99
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,080
(Everything ahead remains perfectly visible.)

100
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,670
Surprised?

101
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,220
Teacher is one of the strongest beings
in the universe.

102
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,670
He can change rules with his words.

103
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,450
If he says that countless beings
whose lifespans have reached

104
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,810
their end shall fall,

105
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,270
then countless powerhouses will fall.

106
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,250
If he says a star shall vanish,

107
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,820
or a planet shall release endless radiance,

108
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,200
then it will be so.

109
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,300
If he says the limit is no longer light-speed,

110
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
but ten times the speed of light,

111
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,620
then within this region,

112
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,270
tenfold light-speed becomes reality.

113
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,990
Do you know why

114
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,080
the Nine Spiral Nebula exists in the distance?

115
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,780
I do not, Teacher.

116
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,540
It is the Starry Tower actively absorbing
cosmic energy

117
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,740
to sustain itself.

118
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,760
You cannot provide such overwhelming energy,

119
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,300
so you cannot fully drive it.

120
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,300
That is why the Starry Tower

121
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,300
must remain here.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,730
As a substitute,

123
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,160
you may use this.

124
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,790
This is the "Star Map."

125
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,760
It can contain a massive number
of Sealing Stars.

126
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,150
I will place one hundred inside for now.

127
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,730
When your cultivation matures,

128
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,610
the remaining 16,135 idle Sealing Stars
inside the tower

129
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,010
may also be merged into the scroll.

130
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,630
The Sealing Stars that kings across all races
fight desperately for

131
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,870
now lie before me within a single scroll.

132
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,290
That's the structure of
the "Heaven-Rending Claw".

133
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,990
It seems the Star Map

134
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,730
can channel any secret technique
I can conceive.

135
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,430
This is truly the supreme treasure
of a spirit master.

136
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,520
Now that you have the Star Map

137
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
and a powerful soul,

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,880
you need one last item

139
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,520
to end everything.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,840
(This is...)

141
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,550
(Three sets of coordinates appeared
in my mind.)

142
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,280
(Yinfa Secret Realm, Planet Jansen)
(The Nine Tribulations Codex fragments!)

143
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,530
The Codex consists of five pieces.

144
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,560
You need to find the remaining three,

145
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,210
each hidden in a dangerous location.

146
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,690
You must retrieve each at Realm Lord, Immortal,

147
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,920
and Cosmic Sage stages.

148
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,590
Once you have gathered the complete Codex,

149
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,790
you will not be far from fully controlling

150
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,130
the Starry Tower.

151
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,970
Understood.

152
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,180
=Swallowed Star=
=Starry Tower=

153
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,360
I have lived through countless eras.

154
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,530
The past drifts away like the wind.

155
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,040
But

156
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,330
I will remember this moment.

157
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,630
I will work hard, Teacher.

158
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,730
I will lead the Earth lineage

159
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,310
to stand among the strongest of the universe.

160
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,050
Since you have met our teacher,

161
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,100
my duty is finished.

162
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,040
You are leaving too?

163
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,070
From now on, the Starry Tower
is yours to manage.

164
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,040
I may finally travel the universe freely.

165
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,670
(Because I was under the pressure
of the trials,)

166
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,110
(I couldn't spare awareness to enter

00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,800
(Mails)
Dad, several clan members recently...

171
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,130
- I've brought back treasures
- Great potential...

172
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,270
- from the Battlefield.
- Are you still there?

173
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,650
- Family gathering...
- Dad.

174
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,850
I met your friends from the VUC.

175
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,480
Brother, great news.

176
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,270
Return to Rainshine Mountain.

177
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,430
- We will gather.
- After meeting your family,

178
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,080
- come see me.
- Why aren't you challenging the Sky Bridge?

179
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,950

(Xu Xin, 35,029)

182
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,990
Feng, it has been three thousand years.

183
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,510
Where on earth have you gone?

Feng,

186
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm now on a remote planet
in the Belho Starfield.

187
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,930
The scenery is beautiful,

188
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,650
yet it feels far too lonely.

189
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,620
Feng, the Ross family has been restless lately,

190
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,160
but don't worry.

191
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,160
I will fight for the Luo family no matter what.

192
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,400
(We are only over ten thousand years old.)

193
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,740
(But the 6,000 years inside the Starry Tower)

194
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,910
(forced us apart for half our lifetime.)

195
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,260
(I could only catch glimpses)

196
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,800
(of her lonely years through emails.)

197
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,160
(I must spend)

198
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,470
(my entire life making up for it.)

199
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,680
Feng, where are you?

200
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,250
I miss you so much.

Dad.

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Is the pressure too much?

206
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,230
Dad,

207
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,770
as long as you come back,

208
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,930
none of this matters.

209
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,930
The population scale of our Luo family

210
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,460
has expanded to the size of over
ten thousand life planets.

211
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,900
When you were here, we could still manage.

212
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,400
But Dad,

213
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,000
you've been gone too long.

214
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,560
Rumors of your fall are spreading.

215
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,650
All forces are stirring,

216
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,310
trying to get the Luo territory.

217
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,750
I shouldn't be gone for so long.

218
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,220
Where's your mother?

219
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,300
She's negotiating with representatives
of the Ross family.

220

Their family is backing down
on business matters,

221
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,190
relying on their King-level Immortal patriarch.

222

A year ago,

223
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,590
one of our Luo family juniors killed a member

224
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,750
of the Ross family to protect a servant.

225
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,700
They used this to escalate the conflict,

226
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,550
demanding compensation.

227
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,790
They're negotiating with Mom now

228
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,440
because of this incident.

A mere Early King-level Immortal,

and he dares to be so arrogant?

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,730
He's seeking death.

233
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,280
Mrs. Luo,

234
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,330
the negotiations have reached the seventh day.

235
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,300
This is the last day.

236
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,390
If there is still no resolution,

237
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,670

Boss!

240
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,670
I didn't expect

241
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,780
the Ross family representative

242
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,880
to be you.

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,730
Leave it to me now.

Trying to play dirty while I'm away?

246
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,100
Are ou tired of living?

247
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,780
We...

248
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,460
We were only discussing possible solutions.

249
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,840
Please don't force our two families
into full hostility.

250
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,260
Still talking back?

251
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,770
Have her reconnect to the virtual universe.

252
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,720
Or next time,

253
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,380
the one who dies will be her real body.

254
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,210
Yes, yes!

255
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,900
Everything you've done is nothing

256
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,290
more than trying to force me to appear,

257
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,730
testing whether I truly fell.

258
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,450
With me here,

259
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,320
your strength is nowhere near enough
to stand equal to the Luo family.

260
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,400
This negotiation

261
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,330
is no longer necessary.

262
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,300
Tell your patriarch, King Swordscrush,

263
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,170
that if he doesn't give me a perfect answer

264
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,650
for everything the Ross family has done,

265
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,780
I don't mind

266
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,500
letting him perish

267
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,870
and erasing the entire Ross family.

268
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,930
That includes your BDM royal clan.

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,190

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,600
Yes.

272
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,080
Let's go.

(After accompanying Xu Xin,)

274
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,150
(I went to report my 6,00 years)

275
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,840
(of cultivation to the Chaos City Lord.)

276
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,250
(He said that once I

277
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,550
pass the Realm Lord level
Original Sky Mountain,)

278
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,810
(he'll arrange for me to join)

279
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,160
(the Hone Alliance again under the name
"Luo Feng.")

280
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,920
(This way,)

281
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,400
(I alone)

282
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
(can possess two Hone Alliance memberships.)

283
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,390
(Then I purchased over three million
Chaos Coins worth of wine)

284
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,570
(to bring to my teacher, King Derivative.)

(While we were drinking joyfully,)

286
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,500
(a message arrived from King Swordscrush.)

287
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,110
(He claimed he would come in person
to apologize.)

288
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,020
(He allowed his subordinates to trouble
the Luo family.)

289

(No matter how humble he acts now,)

290
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
(this matter cannot simply be brushed aside.)

291
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,230
(I demanded 99% of their assets
as compensation)

292
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,390
(and that all those involved be handed over
to the Luo family.)

(Only after everything was settled)

294
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,860
(could I finally sit down with my family)

295
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,610
(for a long-awaited reunion meal.)

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,900
Wonderful!

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,690
(It can give birth to Emperor, King, General
and Soldier souls.)

299
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,220
(When merged into the soul, it greatly
strengthens it.)

five-colored light,)

303
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,010
(storing Original Soul and countless
sub-souls.)

304

(and can only fuse deuterium.)

311

(The heat and light produced
is extremely limited.)

(Thus it is called a brown dwarf.)

(Next Episode Preview)
A large-scale hunt

349
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,070
is about to begin.

350
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,740
Guess what I found.

351
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,520
Where are the aliens?

352
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,810
(King Cushoo)

353
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,050

(King Beimay)

359
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,060
Interesting.

360
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,470
I gave my all to rescue King Tienson.

361
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,770
No way.

362
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,440
Instead, I was attacked by my own people.

363
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,620
Die!

364
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,220
You dare covet the treasure
with such meager power?

365
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,570
(So fast! The Wings of Slayer Wu
can't dodge it.)

366
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,200
You managed to survive one of my thrown swords.

367
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,860
You have some skill.

368
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,370
King Sevenswords.

369
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:20,550
