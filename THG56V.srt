00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,790
Hey, you.

4
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,830
Are you following the series?

5
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,160
Have you dropped a coin

6
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,160
and smashed that like button?

7
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,890
Please,

8
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,460
give us that triple support!

9
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm begging you!

Episode 56
(Mount Shenglin Chapter)
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,040
There are many disciples
of the Heavenly Saint Sect within Yongzhou.

16
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,260
Seeing the situation here,

17
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,690
what are your thoughts?

18
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,040
You assisted the Imperial Preceptor
in founding the academies,

19
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,620
yet our sect's disciples have nowhere to study.

20
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,930
You thought of the world,

21
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,760
but forgot about the Saint Sect.

22
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,930
You should establish primary, secondary,

23
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,390
and imperial academies within our sect,

24
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,710
so our disciples won't fall behind the times.

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,340
That is the duty of the Sect Master,

26
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,350
not the Grandmaster.

27
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,270
Why didn't the previous Sect Master do it?

28
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,980
He was infatuated

29
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,030
with his wife

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,330
and no longer cared for the people.

31
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,090
Why don't we

32
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,610
select outstanding disciples from our sect

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,860
and have them take part
in the Imperial Academy's examinations?

34
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,040
That way, the Academy can help nurture our disciples.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,130
If only you had been born 40 years earlier.

36
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,690
Left and Right Guardians,

37
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,130
are all our people assembled?

38
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,350
The Sect Mistress and the Saintess have yet to arrive.

39
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,590
Of the Four Great Kings of our sect,

40
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,680
King Qian still hasn't returned yet.

41
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,860
We're gathering this openly?

42
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,400
Could it be

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
that the main altar of our sect is located here in Yongzhou?

44
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,440
All 360 halls, raise your banners!

45
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,590
Junior Sect Master,

46
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,590
this is the holy land of the Heavenly Saint Sect,

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,630
Mount Shenglin.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,890
Are Mu and the Grandmaster here?

49
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,190
Youyou,

50
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,490
show some restraint.

51
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,340
Who told you to reveal your true form?

52
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,900
The child you raised is about to become the Sect Master.

53
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,750
Do you want to turn his enthronement into a farce?

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,530
That's more like it.

55
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,660
Let's go.

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,960
Grandma!

57
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,750
Greetings, Junior Sect Master.
I am Si Yunxiang, the Saintess.

58
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,140
Saintess?

59
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,270
Our current Saintess is much more well-behaved.

60
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,080
The last one was a real troublemaker.

61
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,630
- I'm still here! - Grandma...

62
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,570
What's your problem, old fool?

63
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,560
Mu,

64
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,570
Xiang is from our Si family.

65
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,730
After the Grandmaster met her,

66
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,450
he personally trained her for several years.

67
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,150
No wonder she always reminded me of Grandma Si.

68
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,630
King Qian still hasn't arrived?

69
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,330
Not yet.

70
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,560
Look into it.

71
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
See that King Qian's family is well cared for.

72
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,890
Imperial Preceptor,

73
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,430
there's unrest in Yongzhou.

74
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,090
The senior members of the Heavenly Demon Sect
have gathered there,

75
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,140
and the City Lord's Mansion vanished into thin air.

76
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
I see.

77
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,730
It's the top demonic sect.

78
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,930
We cannot take them lightly.

79
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,020
If you knew who their Grandmaster is,

80
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,300
you wouldn't be so alarmed.

81
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,090
Their Grandmaster?

82
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,030
He was the Grand Chancellor of the Imperial Academy.

83
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,690
So he has been hiding here all this time.

84
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,790
Could he be...?

85
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,030
You're overthinking it.

86
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,460
Years ago, I traveled the land

87
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,130
to learn from all the great sects,

88
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,890
but I found each one hoarding its knowledge

89
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,330
and guarding its teachings,

90
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,990
which stifled the wider progress
of cultivation arts and techniques.

91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,840
So I began visiting them,

92
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,250
hoping to tear down those barriers.

93
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,620
The first person I met

94
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,230
was the Grandmaster of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

95
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,360
He was the first to cast aside sectarian pride

96
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,800
and teach me sincerely,

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,090
showing me a clear path forward.

98
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,790
He even personally recommended me to the Dao Master.

99
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,290
Because of his recommendation,
the Dao Master treated me with favor

100
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,490
and granted me access to "The Fourteen Dao Sword Forms".

101
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,390
He also helped me gain entry to the Great Thunderclap Sect

102
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,560
to receive the teachings of Rulai.

103
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,890
Though he never revealed his identity,

104
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,490
he couldn't hide it from me.

105
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,290
Nor did he try.

106
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,430
(Hall of the Imperial Academy)

107
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,570
I invited him to oversee the Imperial Academy

108
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,530
not because of his skills,

109
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,290
nor because of his identity as
the Grandmaster of the Heavenly Demon Sect,

110
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,190
but because of his broad-mindedness.

111
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,110
He was the first person I ever met
with such purity and magnanimity of heart.

112
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,800
(Hall of the Imperial Academy)

113
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,360
Only he was fit to lead the Imperial Academy.

114
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,990
He is both my teacher

115
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,060
and my companion on the Way.

116
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,060
If he is your companion,

117
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,990
why did he resign and leave?

118
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,049
Likely for the next Sect Master of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

119
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,690
I will go and meet this new Sect Master myself.

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,059
If our paths align, he will thrive.

121
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,659
If they diverge, he will perish.

122
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,150
A blessed day,

123
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,320
a fortunate hour.

124
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,030
As heaven and earth unite,

125
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,850
endless blessings descend!

126
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,290
Disciples of the Heavenly Saint Sect,
welcome the Junior Sect Master to the throne!

127
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,560
Welcome to the throne, Junior Sect Master.

128
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,160
Welcome to the throne, Junior Sect Master!

129
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,290
Welcome to the throne, Junior Sect Master!

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Grandmaster,

131
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,520
why do we call the Sect Master's inauguration
an enthronement?

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
Isn't "enthronement" for emperors?

133
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,630
In the golden age of our sect,

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,330
we ruled six nations.

135
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,880
Their emperors were all our subjects.

136
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,450
Calling the Sect Master's inauguration
an enthronement was, in truth,

137
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,990
an honor for the emperors.

138
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,090
(Hall of the Sage's Heart)
But times have changed.

139
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,960
Now, a nation is the greatest of all sects.

140
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,120
A sect can no longer make everyone its disciple,

141
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,530
but a nation

142
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
can make everyone within its borders

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,990
its people.

(Tales of Herding Gods Season 3)

146
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,810
The Heavenly Demon Sect is gathering in Yongzhou.

147
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,890
They're likely about to install a new Sect Master.

148
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,530
They've been in chaos for over 40 years.

149
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,890
The arrival of this new leader

150
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,900
is no blessing for the people.

151
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,760
He must be eliminated.

152
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,260
Understood.

153
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,310
The Imperial Preceptor of Yankang has adopted
the Heavenly Demon Sect's doctrine as his guiding principle.

154
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,480
Yankang Nation has effectively become
a vast extension of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

155
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,340
What should our Dao Sect do about that?

156
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,360
The Imperial Preceptor's ability cannot match his ambition.

157
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,660
History has seen geniuses greater than him

158
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,700
and empires grander than Yankang Nation,

159
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,560
yet they all turned to dust
and then to the Great Wasteland in the end.

160
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,930
This world is far more complicated than he imagines.

161
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,030
When he suffers a crushing defeat, he will learn the truth.

162
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,020
Although Mount Shenglin now lies beyond the heavens,

163
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,430
it was once part of the mortal world.

164
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,670
When our founding master Wei Suifeng first came here,

165
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,790
he saw a woodcutter

166
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,380
felling this very pine.

167
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,990
Each time the axe struck, the tree would regrow

168
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,420
the missing piece.

169
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,730
Realizing he had met a sage,

170
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,460
the founding master sought his teaching.

171
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,680
The woodcutter sat upon this rock and began to preach,

172
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,860
continuing for decades.

173
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,550
The founding master later compiled the sage's words

174
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,270
and wrote "The Ultimate Heavenly Demon Codex" for the world.

175
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,230
Qin Mu,

176
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,040
will you inherit the founding master's virtues, wisdom,

177
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,760
principles, and knowledge?

178
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,390
Yes, I will.

179
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,460
Then

180
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,930
the sect will be yours.

181
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,060
You must bear its weight.

182
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,630
I will.

183
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,290
This is the Sage Rock

184
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,890
and Sage Seat.

185
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,490
The woodcutter sage
and the founding master shared no bloodline

186
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,590
or personal gain.

187
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,430
He taught simply because one sought the Way.

188
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,490
The Saint Sect has endured for over 20,000 years.

189
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,730
Once you sit upon the Sage Rock,

190
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,190
you become the Sect Master and Saint Master,

191
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,660
charged with passing on our teachings, guarding our faith,

192
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,890
and carrying the Heavenly Saint Sect into the future.

193
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,990
We pay our respects to you, Sect Master!

194
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,380
(Great Thunderclap Sect)

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,990
Fresh reports say

196
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,640
the prefect of Yongzhou
is Elder Yulin of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

197
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,480
Yongzhou has become a fortress of the sect.

198
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,660
Si Yunxiang, who defeated the Chanzi,
has also appeared there.

199
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,560
She is likely one of their disciples.

200
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,980
This gathering may be related to their new Sect Master.

201
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,520
(Great Thunderclap Sect)

202
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,360
The Heavenly Demon Sect
has been without a leader for over 40 years.

203
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,670
It has been riven by internal strife,

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
leaving it no time to meddle in Yankang's reforms.

205
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,300
(Great Thunderclap Sect)

206
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,660
But just a while ago, the Imperial Academy
used one of the Heavenly Demon Sect's disciples

207
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,350
to defeat our Chanzi.

208
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,130
If this was their new Sect Master's doing,

209
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,990
we cannot let it pass.

210
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,520
Understood.

211
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,350
There is one more matter.

212
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,460
Junior Brother Ma came out from the Great Wasteland.

213
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,540
Fate moves as it must.

214
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,050
Go investigate the new Sect Master
of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

215
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,660
I will personally settle this karmic debt.

216
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,190
Li Tianxing,

217
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,930
the new Sect Master has ascended the throne.

218
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,940
Aren't you going to appear and pass on our sect's arts?

219
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,390
Do you mean to take them to the grave?

220
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,400
I obey the law of the sect.

221
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,810
So Grandma's inner demon was Master Li all along.

222
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,540
Traveler,

223
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,870
you have watched from there for a long time.

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,530
What have you seen?

225
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,890
Please enlighten me, Sage.

226
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,990
Traveler,

227
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,460
your kin are already bones in their graves.

228
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,790
You have stood here watching for 100 years.

229
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,790
Have you seen anything?

230
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,730
Humans, demons, ghosts, and spirits

231
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,360
all follow their courses.

232
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,720
All creatures follow their own natural patterns.

233
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,930
That is the great constant of existence.

234
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,620
So the Great Unity Technique
of "The Ultimate Heavenly Demon Codex"

235
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,630
was hidden in the Sage's discourse.

236
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,460
How much one grasps

237
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,560
depends on one's own fortune.

238
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,260
Grandmaster,

239
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,890
the transmission is complete.

240
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,560
I must now seek a way to break free.

241
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,390
Only by destroying her (him)

242
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,720
can I devote myself wholly to cultivation
and advance further.

243
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,870
It is not yet certain who will destroy whom.

244
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,550
Grandmaster,

245
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,670
when Mu wakes, tell him

246
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,690
to come home for the New Year.

247
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,830
I'm leaving.

248
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,600
(Heavenly Saint Sect)

249
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,500
([Doctrine]: "The Way of the Sage is no different
from the people's daily life.)

250
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,560
(Whatever departs from it is heresy.
To follow one's true will and live in full accord)

251
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,300
(with nature is the Way." This is the foundation
of the Heavenly Saint Sect's creed and the opening tenet)

252
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,450
(of "The Ultimate Heavenly Demon Codex.")

253
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:16,230
([Origin]
The 360 cultivation paths taught by the woodcutter sage)

254
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,900
(became the origin of the Heavenly Saint Sect's 360 halls.)

255
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,390
The founding master gained endless insight

256
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,860
yet was still not satisfied,

257
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,490
so he asked the woodcutter...

258
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,530
May I ask, Sage,

259
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,590
how can I become a sage?

260
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,910
You must establish virtue,
establish merit, and establish teachings.

261
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,820
Thus, you will die yet not perish and become a sage.

262
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,800
How can one become imperishable?

263
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,090
You must first achieve the Three Clarities:

264
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,410
Clarity in principle, clarity in knowledge,
and clarity in teaching.

265
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,060
Only then can you become
the Saint Master of thousands of people.

266
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,230

(for more exciting news and surprise benefits)

269
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,490
When I left the Great Wasteland,

270
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,460
the grandpas and Grandma Si of Canlao Village
walked a long way with me.

271
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,530
I kept turning back again and again,

272
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,130
and each time I did, they followed me a little farther.

273
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,760
How I wish I could stay by their side

274
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,560
in Canlao Village forever.

275
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,760
But I know

276
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,830
that only by traveling farther to cultivate

277
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,890
can I find the Way that belongs to me.

278
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,260
(They taught me everything)
Grandma Si,

279
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,660
aren't you the one who least wants Mu to leave the village?

280
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,760
(But they never learned how to say goodbye)
Every fledgling

281
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,360
must leave the nest someday.

282
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,290
I didn't leave the village because I missed Mu.

283
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I have real business to take care of.

284
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,100
- I'm leaving to check on my leg.
- The grandpas and Grandma Si of Canlao Village...

285
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,890
- I'm out to avenge the loss of my eyes.
- gave me everything.

286
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,060
- As the former Saintess of the Saint Sect...
- On those nights in Yankang...

287
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,760
- It's only right that I go meet...
- I often thought of them.

288
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,530
- the new Sect Master. - I believe they think of me, too.

289
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,360
They just

290
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,660
don't say it out loud.

291
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,060
So we all have real business to attend to after all!

292
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,030
But beyond Yankang and the Great Wasteland,

293
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,230
in every village all over the world,

294
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,060
there are grandpas and grandmas like mine.

295
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,860
They keep watch over empty homes

296
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,960
and think about their children far away.

297
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,430
Let's be there for them.

298
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,360
We can start with small things, like sharing a meal.

299
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,490
Bilibili Charity Platform's Elderly Companion Program

300
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,830
supports rural elders suffering from malnutrition.

301
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,660
Each month, it delivers nutritious food

302
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,530
and celebrates festivals and birthdays with them.

This lasting care

304
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,630
has become a source of warmth

305
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,290
in their lives.

306
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,360
Their companionship

307
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,130
gave us the courage to face the world.

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
Your kindness

311
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,690
will be recognized with a special certificate

312
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,430
that marks this bond of warmth and care.

313
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,930
Join me in sharing a meal with them.

315

Mu,

316
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,830
go and make your own way.

317
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,230
We're all

318
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,630
doing just fine.
