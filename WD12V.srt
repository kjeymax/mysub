FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,800
We can only fabricate another piece of evidence

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
to save them.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,840
Before this feather touches the ground,

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,900
if I don't pluck a hair from your head,

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,300
I'll admit defeat.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,000
Today we'll use the martial arts our master taught us

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,930
to earn a living.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,540
Breaking stones on the chest!

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,280
80 copper coins!

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,130
May I have two pieces of your calligraphy?

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,500
Not only this diamond,

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,480
I'm also willing to offer a thousand taels of gold.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,040
[Eighty]

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,640
I have more good news for you.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
We brothers have become famous.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,240
Capture Zu Beiqiu alive!

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,500
Seize Zheng Dongting!

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,640
Brother,

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,540
you should escape on your own.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,480
Guild Master Guan,

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,800
forgive my sudden visit.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
I apologize for any offense.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've found important clues about the Luo family massacre

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,660
and had to rush here urgently.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,440
We've all misunderstood Zheng Dongting and Zu Beiqiu.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,640
The Luo family massacre wasn't their doing,

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,520
but the work of the Taihangshanzhài gang.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,850
Here's a letter written in blood as proof.

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,220
Who goes there?

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Guild Master Guan,

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,340
help me capture this villain!

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,720
Guild Master Guan,

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,250
look out!

35
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,400
We've arrived.

36
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
What's all this noise?

37
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,450
Have you no dignity as members of a respectable sect?

38
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,480
Zheng Dongting,

39
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
Zu Beiqiu,

40
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,600
are merely suspects in the Luo family massacre

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,760
and haven't been formally convicted yet.

42
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,880
We're not like the Taihangshanzhài gang.

43
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,840
We need evidence.

44
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,640
I am Elder Wang of the Guanzhong Sword School,

45
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,840
Wang Guchang,

46
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,040
and also the chief of the Martial Alliance's Execution Hall.

47
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm responsible for interrogating major criminals in the martial world.

48
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,520
You're suspected of massacring the entire Luo family.

49
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
Now,

50
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,640
will you confess to your crimes?

51
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,400
Elder Wang,

52
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
my brother and I are innocent.

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,480
How dare you, Zheng Dongting!

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,440
At the end of your rope,

55
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
yet still trying to deny it?

56
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,780
Where is the executioner?

57
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,159
Bring out the punishment rods!

58
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,120
Beat them until they confess!

59
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,240
Didn't you just say respectable sects need evidence?

60
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,100
Hold your hand!

61
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Fellow martial artists,

62
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,260
you must stay away from vice and corruption,

63
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,400
and uphold the virtuous ways of our great Tang dynasty.

64
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,560
Elder Wang speaks wisely.

65
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,120
Guards!

66
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,280
Put Zheng Dongting in cell Tian-A.

67
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,800
And put Zu Beiqiu

68
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,600
in cell Tian-B.

69
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,760
You're putting them with those two prisoners?

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,980
Isn't that a bit...

71
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,080
These days, thieves are everywhere

72
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,810
and our cells are overcrowded.

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,840
If anything happens to Zu Beiqiu

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,000
or Zheng Dongting,

75
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,440
blame it on these troubled times.

76
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Hahaha!

77
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,840
You're awake?

78
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
Where am I?

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
Cell Tian Yi.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,080
For high-profile criminals.

81
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,010
Brother Zu, you deserve this cell.

82
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,960
May I ask,

83
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,600
did you kill everyone in the Luo family?

84
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,159
No, no.

85
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,760
Zheng Dongting killed half of them.

86
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,160
No, no.

87
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,760
Anyway,

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,000
what you did was deeply satisfying to many.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,320
Haha!

90
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,480
Pleased to meet you.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,160
I haven't asked your name

92
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,850
and why you're imprisoned?

93
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
My humble name isn't worth mentioning.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As for me,

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm here for deflowering women.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
In our world,

97
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,240
is there anything wrong with picking flowers?

98
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,160
Brother Zu,

99
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,520
could you be a fellow practitioner?

100
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,980
You're Zheng Dongting who wiped out the Luo family.

101
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
I didn't.

102
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm not.

103
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,280
What a coward.

104
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,520
At this point,

105
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,159
if you killed them, just admit it.

106
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,600
Why hide it?

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,640
You're...

108
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,200
you're the Lion King Duan Teng.

109
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
That's right,

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,440
it's me.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,080
Legend has it

112
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,480
you killed all Tianshan disciples who could use the Night Falling Stars sword.

113
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
I did kill quite a few.

114
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,040
The Night Falling Stars sword technique is what I hate most in my life.

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,280
I watched hundreds of my brothers die under that sword.

116
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,480
You look familiar.

117
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,600
Have we met somewhere before?

118
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Impossible.

119
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,000
We've never met.

120
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,840
You're scum of the martial world,

121
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
a disciple of Mu Tianhou.

122
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,240
You dare call my master scum?

123
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,800
I merely killed innocents.

124
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,760
Your master was a thief and a fraud,

125
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,960
deceiving everyone.

126
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,500
Absolutely disgraceful.

127
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,640
Years ago, your master used sweet talk

128
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
to steal the Night Falling Stars sword technique

129
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,520
from Tianshan heroine Ye Ting.

130
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,480
I suppose your master must have taught

131
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,320
you that sword technique.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I swear

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,880
I will never use the Night Falling Stars sword.

134
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
Let's have a friendly match,

135
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
not a real fight.

136
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,420
Not even a friendly match.

137
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,160
If you won't take the easy way,

138
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,560
you'll take the hard way.

139
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:12,084
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

140
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,040
Fine then.

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Tonight I was planning to escape from this prison,

142
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
but because you came in,

143
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,400
I decided to stay and have a match with you.

144
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,280
Master Duan wants to escape?

145
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,700
Don't let me delay you.

146
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,160
How do you plan to escape?

147
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,010
I plan to kill the inmates with my Lion's Roar,

148
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,970
and escape while they're collecting the bodies.

149
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
What do you think?

150
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,480
A friendly match isn't really fighting.

151
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,720
Since Master Duan is in the mood,

152
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,600
I'll oblige.

153
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,520
Elder Wang handled this matter beautifully.

154
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,760
Just thinking about Zheng Dongting and Zu Beiqiu

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,880
meeting those two demons in prison,

156
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,400
I almost feel sorry for them.

157
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,320
Yes.

158
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,440
We've saved face

159
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,920
and pacified Ouyang Fei and the injured members of the Jixiong Alliance.

160
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,960
I hope Elder Wang will continue to guide us in the future.

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,490
Such is the world we live in.

162
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,880
What can we do about it?

163
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Let's drink to this damned world.

164
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,240
Cheers!

165
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,840
Good.

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Speaking of famous flowers,

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,280
one cannot avoid mentioning it.

168
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,240
Heavenly fragrance stains clothes at night,

169
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,640
national beauty intoxicates in morning wine.

170
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,160
Only the peony is truly the nation's beauty,

171
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,280
when it blooms, the capital stirs.

172
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,840
The peony,

173
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,360
it's full-bodied.

174
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Good.

175
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Well said.

176
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,560
Your verses, brother,

177
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
make me dream of Luoyang.

178
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,160
What about peach blossoms?

179
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,600
Mirrors before and after reflect the flowers,

180
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,440
flower faces shine upon each other.

181
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,280
Purple paths and red dust brush against the face,

182
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,120
everyone comes to see the flowers bloom.

183
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,840
Peach blossoms,

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,360
they're enchanting.

185
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,200
Good.

186
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Peach blossoms are indeed bewitching,

187
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,400
so bewitching that I can't resist their charm.

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,400
How about apricot blossoms?

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,760
Delicate beauty transforms thrice,

190
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,400
a tree full of spring breeze.

191
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,840
Let you pick them and look with care,

192
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,930
they say spring breeze reaches the flower stems.

193
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,080
Apricot blossoms,

194
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,880
they're tender.

195
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,520
If one obtains apricot blossoms,

196
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
it's like passing the imperial exam.

197
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,240
Truly the most romantic thing in the world.

198
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,080
What about lotus flowers?

199
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,400
Lotus emerges from clear water,

200
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,720
naturally unadorned.

201
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,000
Meeting her lover, she wants to speak but lowers her head and smiles,

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,280
jade hairpin falls into the water as she touches her hair.

203
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,960
Lotus flowers,

204
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,480
they're fresh and pure.

205
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,100
Brother, you're so talented.

206
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,240
I can picture it all.

207
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,160
Now about chrysanthemums.

208
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm going to use the Eighteen Beast Blade technique.

209
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,400
First form:

210
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,120
White Dragon Emerges from the Sea.

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,360
Blade stands upright attacking the middle,

212
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,960
blade tip points at the brow.

213
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,360
Hold this hand position,

214
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,240
look carefully.

215
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,480
A line of stars breaks through the sky,

216
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,720
long sword strikes from above.

217
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,640
Pointing diagonally to the sky,

218
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,560
sword sweeps across the heavens.

219
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,080
Strike here,

220
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,880
here.

221
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Tiger Tucks Tail.

222
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,840
Crafty Rabbit's Three Burrows,

223
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,480
retreat three steps.

224
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,400
Dodge to the left,

225
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
blade twists behind.

226
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,840
Side roll.

227
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,360
Damn you!

228
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,090
You dare to counter-attack me?

229
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,840
This blade of mine could split a mountain in half.

230
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,040
Why didn't you dodge?

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,400
You first used White Dragon Emerges from the Sea,

232
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,440
your next move would surely be a horizontal slash.

233
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,560
If I had retreated,

234
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,000
I would have given you the advantage.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
How could I dodge?

236
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,400
Aren't you afraid of dying together with me?

237
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,680
I'll strike first.

238
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Your strike looks fierce,

239
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
but it's just a feint.

240
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,450
Your energy is weak,

241
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,380
no match for the speed of my sword.

242
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,040
Your swordsmanship,

243
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,240
why is it different from other swordsmen?

244
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,280
They don't use their swords correctly.

245
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,160
Not correctly.

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
Green Monkey Offering Fruit,

247
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,380
Rolling Body Through Clever Clouds.

248
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,520
Three Advancing Strikes.

249
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Watch this.

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,400
This.

251
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,160
How will you counter?

252
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,920
Starry Rain Washing Autumn Pond.

253
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,480
What the...

254
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,160
What?

255
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,200
You're stealing my glory again.

256
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,120
My Green Monkey Offering Fruit is a swift strike.

257
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,480
Your blade weighs 38 jin,

258
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,400
your arms are 4 chi long,

259
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
and you're over 8 chi tall.

260
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,400
By the time your blade reaches my vital points,

261
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,260
my sword would have already turned you into a sieve.

262
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,000
Lazy Donkey

263
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,480
Rolling.

264
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,120
Eighteen Tumbles,

265
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,960
body lying sideways.

266
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,840
Enough.

267
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,160
You don't need to describe how a lazy donkey rolls.

268
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,090
I can imagine it.

269
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,800
Green Blade Crossing Sky, Seven Stars Falling.

270
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,440
Is it my turn to make a move?

271
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,720
You're rolling on the ground.

272
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,600
How can you attack?

273
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,880
My move is an aerial strike,

274
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,040
delivering seven consecutive sword thrusts.

275
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,840
Keep rolling.

276
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,400
Carp Leaping Dragon Gate,

277
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,520
Stars Illuminating Three Thousand Paths,

278
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,600
Black Bear Hugging Tree,

279
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,920
Flying Star Flirting with Queen Mother of the West.

280
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,000
Dilu Horse Crossing Stream,

281
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
Star Light Fading on Western Window Tree.

282
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,970
I'll fight you with my Rabbit Kicking Eagle move!

283
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,400
One Night of Stars,

284
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,930
Falling in Western Sky.

285
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,580
Brilliant blossoms still flourish.

286
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,960
No news from the beauty.

287
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,680
Lonely eastern fence wet with dew.

288
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,200
Golden dimples still reflect in mud and sand.

289
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,360
Autumn threads surround the house like Tao's home.

290
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,120
Encircling the fence as day turns to sunset.

291
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,240
Rustling west wind fills the courtyard,

292
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,840
cold stamens and chilled fragrance keep butterflies away.

293
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,760
When autumn comes on the eighth of September,

294
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,120
my flowers bloom while others wither.

295
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Brother,

296
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,880
I still have two flowers.

297
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,440
They're at the Earth God Temple on South Mountain.

298
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,880
Help me.

299
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,840
I remember now.

300
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,240
It's you.

301
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,400
It's you.

302
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,240
So it was you.

303
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Brother Ouyang, why are you so late?

304
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,960
The wine is cold now.

305
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,960
Elder Wang.

306
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,530
Something's happened.

307
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,320
Brother Ouyang.

308
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,880
Something happened to those two villains, right?

309
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,360
These two truly live up to their reputation.

310
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,240
In that case,

311
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,880
their bodies still need to be properly collected.

312
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,620
I've already asked people to bring them out.

313
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
Elder Wang,

314
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,720
would you like to examine them?

315
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,400
- Let's go.

316
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,980
- Let's all take a look.

317
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,280
Evil truly gets its just deserts.

318
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,040
The time has come.

319
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,360
This way no one will blame us.

320
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,580
Guards!

321
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,560
Bring out Zheng Dongting and Zu Beiqiu.

322
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,960
I will execute these two as a sacrifice.

323
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,120
Bao Yexing is dead.

324
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,920
It's Zu Beiqiu.

325
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,880
We've been wronged, sir!

326
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,440
We didn't kill anyone.

327
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,570
Sir, please investigate thoroughly.

328
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,560
Did Lian Qingyan help you escape?

329
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,600
Master Lian,

330
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,010
how did you get injured?

331
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,490
Master Guan is dead.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,160
The Luo family wasn't actually killed.

333
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,400
They're all alive.

334
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
Young Master Gong,

335
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,760
how did you know the iron box with the blood letter was evidence?

336
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,680
If the Luo family had truly been massacred,

337
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,280
how could I have met the young master of the Luo family?

338
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:37,404
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™
