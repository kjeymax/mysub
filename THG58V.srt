3
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,790
Hey, you.

4
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,830
Are you following the series?

5
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,160
Have you dropped a coin

6
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,160
and smashed that like button?

7
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,890
Please,

8
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,460
give us that triple support!

9
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm begging you!

Episode 58
(Mount Shenglin Chapter)
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

15
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,830
They say the Three-Marvel Fort has three marvels:

16
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,650
First, insects, then medicine, and last, beautiful women.

17
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,830
Looks like it's true.

18
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,030
No wonder you produced a Noble Consort.

19
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,350
Fan Yunxiao, the Dao Sect's expelled disciple?

20
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,390
Didn't you run off to be a fire bandit?

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,860
When did you turn over a new leaf?

22
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,230
How did I turn over a new leaf?

23
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,990
Your Cloud-Chasing Pirate Ship is now
a Cloud-Chasing Passenger Ship.

24
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,290
Didn't that mean you turn over a new leaf?

25
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,350
In times of peace, I robbed people for money.

26
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,860
In times of chaos, running a passenger ship
makes money faster than robbery.

27
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,690
General, could you let us pass?

28
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,060
The imperial court has hunted me for years

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,530
and never caught me.

30
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,960
General, are you sure you want to try?

31
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,630
We're leaving.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,630
Master,

33
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,200
a bunch of officials
disguised as merchants are hiding in that ship.

34
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,560
Are we really just letting them go?

35
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,200
We can't delay our trip to the Southern Border.

36
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,000
As for them,

37
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,060
the insects will handle it.

38
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,230
Mr. Qin,

39
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,960
he really is a bandit leader!

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,090
I've gone straight.

41
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,430
Really.

42
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,890
Don't worry.

43
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,390
I'll get all of you safely to the capital.

44
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,960
You're a guest on my ship.

45
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,890
It's my duty to protect you.

46
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,090
Now that you've been robbed,

47
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,760
I can't take your money.

48
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,490
Boss,

49
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,090
the furnace got gnawed by the insects and exploded!

50
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,290
I told you, stop calling me boss.

51
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,710
I've gone straight.

52
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,410
That wretched woman played dirty behind my back.

53
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
Come help!

54
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,590
We'll have to abandon the ship.

55
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,360
It can still be fixed.

56
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,330
Boss, bad news!

57
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,130
The darn insect swarms are back!

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,230
Go help him!

59
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Qin,

60
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,760
my strength will only last one incense stick!

61
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,790
That's enough.

62
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,790
We're saved!

63
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,340
Boss,

64
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,530
this kid fixed the furnace,

65
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,360
and now it's running even hotter than before!

66
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,160
Qin,

67
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,890
who taught you blacksmithing?

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,190
At this speed, when I go back to robbing,

69
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,790
who could ever catch me?

70
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,490
I thought you'd already gone straight.

71
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,760
It's Fan Yunxiao, the fire bandit!

72
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,670
I've gone straight! I'm a law-abiding citizen now.

73
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,960
(Merchant Ship License)
Here, this is my license.

74
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,660
(Cloud-Chasing Passenger Ship)

75
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,530
This ship is called "Cloud-Chasing Passenger Ship".

76
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,270
Let's go.

77
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,060
Qin,

78
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,190
you're wasting your talent by not being a bandit.

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,690
Why not come with me and...?

80
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,810
Fan, you were expelled from the Dao Sect
for your crooked nature,

81
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,610
but I'm a well-regarded scholar at the Imperial Academy.

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,670
By the way,

83
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,780
I heard the Dao Sect had a classic numerology text,

84
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,990
the "Numerology Codex of Supreme Mystery".

85
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,730
Have you seen it?

86
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,960
I happened to steal a copy when I left the Dao Sect.

87
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,490
If you want to learn it,

88
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,930
(Numerology Codex of Supreme Mystery)
it's yours.

89
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,590
This book is used to enlighten their disciples.

90
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,930
Once they master it, they can study the Dao Sword Forms.

91
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,620
If they master all 14 chapters, they'll be unmatched

92
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,460
and godlike.

93
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,360
The Dao Sect uses this codex to identify geniuses

94
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,790
and then trains them in the Dao Sword Forms.

95
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,990
The Academy's reform of genius cultivation

96
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,559
can't wait any longer.

97
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,429
The capital really is the best.

98
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,659
(Yankang)
Once the world is at peace,

99
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,430
my men can go back to the old trade and be bandits again.

100
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,360
Qin, if you ever change your mind,

101
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,590
come find me anytime!

102
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,560
What are you staring at?

103
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
You're skin and bones.

104
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,030
Why don't you go find something to eat?

105
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,760
People bring me food and drinks every day.

106
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,460
Why would I leave?

107
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,130
I'm perfectly comfortable here.

108
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,690
Is eating and drinking all you aspire to?

109
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,490
How could a fox understand a qilin's ambition?

110
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,090
Mr. Qin,

111
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,850
squatting has made this Dragon Qilin stupid.

112
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,730
Let's ignore him!

113
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,360
My master resigned from office

114
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,860
and ran off with an old man.

115
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,490
He abandoned me.

116
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,060
I had nowhere to go,

117
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,860
so I stayed here to guard the gate.

118
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,330
Now a bull bullies me every day.

119
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,810
I'm barely hanging on!

120
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,870
(Imperial Academy)
You were the Grandmaster's mount?

121
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,590
We're from the same sect.

122
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,830
I'm the Sect Master of the Saint Sect.

123
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,830
Don't talk nonsense!

124
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,040
There's no Grandmaster or Sect Master
in the Imperial Academy.

125
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
You knocked me unconscious.

126
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,630
I haven't even settled that score with you!

127
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
That was because you tricked me into fighting that bull.

128
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,190
How about

129
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
I call the bull over

130
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,590
and let you beat him up?

131
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,960
Are you trying to knock me out again?

132
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,780
(Tales of Herding Gods Season 3)

133
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,790
Mr. Qin...

134
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,030
Why are you following me?

135
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,260
You knocked me out,

136
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,490
so you're responsible for feeding me.

137
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,330
Didn't you just say people brought you food every day?

138
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,060
After my master left,

139
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,490
no one cared about me.

140
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,730
I haven't eaten in over a month.

141
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,160
Everyone thinks I'm a stone statue.

142
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,390
And I can't bring myself to beg.

143
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,930
That bull has Chancellor Ba Shan backing him,
so he keeps bullying me,

144
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,390
saying I toyed with his feelings.

145
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,830
Alright, alright.

146
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,830
I'll feed you.

147
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,690
I have money.

148
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,730
What do you eat?

149
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,490
I only drink water from Jade Dragon Lake

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,690
and eat ten liters of Redfire Pills a day.

151
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,830
Mr. Qin,

152
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,830
he'll eat us out of everything we own!

153
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,630
I can starve if I have to.

154
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,560
Five liters is fine.

155
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,860
One liter works, too.

156
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,060
Just one liter.

157
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
That's as low as I go!

158
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,130
I can refine pills myself.

159
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,090
That'll save some money.

160
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,650
You won't go hungry.

161
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,600
But I can't feed you for nothing.

162
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,160
You knocked me out,

163
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,030
and we're from the same sect.

164
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,260
You're the Sect Master,

165
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,730
and I was your Grandmaster's mount.

166
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
It's your responsibility to feed me!

167
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,020
Then you must give me some miracle saliva every day.

168
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,460
Otherwise, I can't afford you.

169
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,530
Miracle saliva?

170
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,660
Your drool.

171
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,030
That's easy.

172
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,890
By the way,

173
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,330
didn't you say you could call that bull over

174
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,660
so I could beat him up?

175
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,130
Don't push your luck,

176
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,290
or I'll cut your daily ration to five liters a day.

177
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:54,814
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

178
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,860
With a body that big,

179
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,260
no wonder he eats so much.

180
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,500
I'll call you Big Dragon from now on.

181
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,030
You'll be the bull's big brother.

182
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,480
Mr. Qin, Sister Ling'er,

183
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,190
I'm still a little hungry.

184
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,430
I'll take you to refine medicine.

185
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,820
From now on, if you are in trouble, Mr. Qin,

186
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,080
just say the word.

187
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,490
I'm great in a fight.

188
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,760
You didn't even dare fight a bull,

189
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,390
and you call that great?

190
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,910
A divine medicine indeed!

191
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,340
Let's run another experiment.

192
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,540
Stop!

193
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,040
Sirs,

194
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,730
how much is this bottle of miracle saliva

195
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,630
worth to you?

196
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,890
Money comes in much faster this way than by robbing others.

197
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,420
Move aside, all of you!

198
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,270
That giant lion is alive?

199
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,090
Mr. Qin,

200
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,490
these blind fools have cleared a path.

201
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,960
Please.

202
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,290
You're drawing too much attention.

203
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,530
Do not do that again.

204
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,280
Senior brothers and sisters,

205
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,000
pardon us.

206
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,290
Cowherd!

207
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,530
Ever since Her Highness returned from that trip,

208
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,890
she's become just like that devil
from the Scholars' Quarters.

209
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,790
She even said she'd beat everyone in the Royal Garden.

210
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,190
Cowherd,

211
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,120
where have you been these days?

212
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:44,830
I...

213
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,830
and Mr. Ba Shan were really worried about you.

214
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,990
You've grown

215
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,610
even stronger since we last met.

216
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,790
Be careful.

217
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,920
The new Grand Chancellor is Gu Li'nuan.

218
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,220
He even asked Daoist Ling Yun about you.

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,560
Erudite Qin, you'd better
return the Shaobao Sword to Gu Li'nuan.

220
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,760
He's notoriously petty.

221
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,490
I can arrange a meeting

222
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,760
so that the two of you

223
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,660
can reconcile.

224
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,930
Otherwise, he might make life difficult for you.

225
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,090
In the Great Wasteland,

226
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,890
anything earned by one's own skill
never needs to be returned.

227
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,790
Besides, Gu Li'nuan said

228
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,130
he was the Crown Prince's teacher.

229
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,030
You're the Second Prince.
Do you really think he'll respect you?

230
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,860
Aren't you worried he'll make things difficult for you?

231
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,030
I will soon petition my father

232
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,460
to let me lead troops at the border.

233
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,450
Yuxiu, the court is full of hidden dangers.

234
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,130
Why don't you come with me?

235
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,860
If I can't bear to stay here anymore,
I'll definitely go to you.

236
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,960
But for now, I want to continue training
under Chancellor Ba Shan.

237
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:46,990
Don't worry, Your Highness.

238
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,790
I'm here with her.

239
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,430
That is exactly what worries me.

240
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,090
Greetings, Grand Chancellor Gu.

241
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,230
You stole my Shaobao Sword.

242
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,290
Did you really think you would never fall into my hands?

243
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,870
Hand it over now!

244
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,230
I was appointed by His Majesty
as an Erudite of the Imperial Academy,

245
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,870
and I saved the Empress Dowager's life.

246
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,390
If you lay a hand on me,

247
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,330
the Emperor will take your head.

248
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,660
A Divine Bridge master

249
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,450
is attacking a Wuyao cultivator?

250
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,890
Shameless.

251
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,060
No need to trouble the Emperor to kill you and your family.

252
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,530
I will do it first!

253
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,990
Chancellor Ba Shan, you want to stand up for this brat?

254
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,230
Gu,

255
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,890
it's been 200 years.

256
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,590
Your soul-summoning spell is outdated now.

257
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,089
Do you need me to teach you a few tricks?

258
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,970
Teach me? Bring me the Heavenly Blade,
and maybe we can talk.

259
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,200
Are you really going to oppose me

260
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,300
for an outcast from the Great Wasteland?

261
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,700
He is my junior brother.

262
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,130
Imperial Preceptor?

263
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,210
I never would've imagined
the Sect Master of the Heavenly Saint Sect

264
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,260
would be the first Erudite of the Imperial Academy.

265
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,090
What an amusing turn of events.

266
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,730
Imperial Preceptor,

267
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,630
you did not come just to say that, did you?

268
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,460
You don't seem

269
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,530
surprised to see me.

270
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,690
The Heavenly Saint Sect accepts all without distinction.

271
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,730
There are many factions within the sect.

272
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,140
It is only natural that you would have

273
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
people among the upper ranks.

274
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,690
Then why are you not afraid?

275
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,790
Aren't you worried I might be here to kill you?

276
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,390
If you mean to kill me,

277
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,030
fear is useless.

278
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,360
If you don't kill me,

279
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,860
the Saint Sect will not rebel.

280
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,690
If you kill me,

281
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,160
then it certainly will.
