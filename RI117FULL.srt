Heavenly Demon Province

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,870
Every three hundred years, a Demon General tourney is held

9
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,910
Beyond the rewards for this contest

10
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,950
two Vice Marshals must also be chosen

11
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,950
I, Wang, will give you my full support

12
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,950
Hu Pao, he…

13
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,150
might already be…

14
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,230
He is still alive

15
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,470
Hu Pao greets his Benefactor

16
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,110
You asked me to find a place to slaughter many

17
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,590
without stirring up trouble

18
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,200
(Flood Prison)

19
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,350
You are the one Mo Lihai mentioned

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,350
That would be me

21
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,950
Come with me

22
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,900

EPISODE 117
[IMPERIAL SWORD]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

24
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,750
(The deathly qi here is so dense)

25
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,590
(The murderous aura, so fierce)

26
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,070
(over ten times stronger than outside)

27
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,270
A newcomer

28
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,630
All fair and tender

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,030
I love peeling this kind of soft skin

30
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,990
The taste of an outsider

31
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,200
Perfect, I can kill one more

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,340
And drink his blood

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,750
These are vile criminals soon to be beheaded

34
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,590
Fellow Daoist Wang, act as you please

35
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,990
(I wonder, if I kill all the condemned here)

36
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,270
(how many strands of Slaughter Aura I can forge)

37
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,660
(Five days later)

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,390
(Just now this place teemed with murderous qi)

39
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,150
(Could it be)

40
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,670
(under this Flood Prison)

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,590
(there lies some hidden mystery)

42
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,990
(Slaughter Immortal Art)

43
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,150
(Use Murderous Aura to temper vitality)

44
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,990
(Turn that vitality into a Mark of Life)

45
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,030
(Why, after killing everyone here)

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,070
(do I gain only useless deathly qi)

47
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,630
(What exactly am I lacking)

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,350
Because your Killing Heart is too weak

49
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,230
If you do not steep yourself in slaughter

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,150
and temper a true Killing Heart

51
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,510
you will never give rise to Murderous Aura

52
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,310
No effort will help you then

53
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,230
Refine the heart through killing

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,510
Use that heart to turn into a demon

55
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,270
That is my path of slaughter

56
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,270
If you wish to learn true slaughter

57
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,350
I can grant you a stroke of fortune

58
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,430
Whether you grasp it or not

59
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,790
depends on your own fate

60
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,470
My condition

61
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,470
As the Prison Warden

62
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,230
I cannot take a single step from Flood Prison

63
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,510
If you succeed

64
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,950
I want you to use the way of slaughter

65
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,070
to kill Demon General Shi Xiao

66
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,700
All right

67
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,870
Come with me

68
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,630
(Such dense Murderous Aura)

69
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,430
(It can stir the Slaughter Aura itself)

70
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,870
(Seems what he said was true)

71
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,590
This is where the Imperial Sword is fed

72
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,240
(Slaughter Blood Pool, Flood Prison)

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,590
Personally opened by the Emperor

74
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
Its Murderous Aura is savage

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,430
Enough to invade the mind

76
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,030
If your heart is not firm

77
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,910
you will likely end up like them

78
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,550
a hollow body, a walking corpse

79
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,790
None who enter this place leave

80
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,560
Have you truly decided

81
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,550
(The place that feeds the Imperial Sword)

82
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,550
(What a slaughter‑filled place)

83
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,710
(This blood mist is refined Murderous Aura)

84
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,230
(A perfect source to train Slaughter Immortal Art)

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,350
(Why can I not fuse with it)

86
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,590
(Or is it that)

87
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,730
(the blood energy is lacking)

88
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,270
(No, that’s wrong)

89
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,000
(Three days later)

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,710
(Still not right)

91
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,750
(The method to turn blood energy to Slaughter Aura)

92
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,120
(What exactly is it)

93
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,110
Who goes there

94
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,760
(With such a cultivation)

95
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,780
(how is he trapped here)

96
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,990
(What a vicious sword force)

97
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,590
(Could this silver dragon be the Imperial Sword)

98
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,870
Let me

99
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,630
out of here

100
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,110
(So that’s it)

101
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,630
(If I want to leave here)

102
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,670
(I must first pass the Imperial Sword)

103
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,390
(No wonder he said none leave this place)

104
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,710
(The Imperial Sword is truly strong)

105
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,990
(I must not face it head‑on)

106
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,350
(That blood mist is what feeds the sword)

107
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,830
(But it’s born from mutual slaughter here)

108
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,230
(Once people are gone, it dries up)

109
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,390
(Why would the Imperial Sword drain its own pond)

110
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,350
(Could it be)

111
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,030
(in the blood pool they cannot die)

112
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,470
(and so they slaughter each other endlessly)

113
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,790
(thus feeding it endless blood mist)

114
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,750
(Who knows how many years they’ve been trapped)

115
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,670
(If I want to get out)

116
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,950
(I must perfect the Slaughter Immortal Art)

117
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,630
(only then will I have a chance)

118

Turn death into life

From life, return to death

134
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,470
This is the cycle that feeds the Imperial Sword

Slaughter Immortal Art

136
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,150
It mimics some unknown‑grade Immortal Art

137

It matches your Domain of Life and Death

138

At last, I am free

147
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,010
You

148
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,670
can even make the blood pool your own

149
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,750
(So the key to Slaughter Immortal Art)

150
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,270
(is also the path of life‑death rebirth)

151

It’s useless

How badly has it been wronged

168
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,790
to be enraged to this extent

169
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,630
What is this

170
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,030
When the Imperial Sword rages,

171
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,910
corpses cover a million

172
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,550
and blood flows for a thousand li.

173
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,860
This sword

174
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,150
in the eyes of you two,

175
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,800
(Hai Zhu, Daluo Sword Sect disciple,
Nascent Transformation Late Stage)

176
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,100
(Weiyang, Daluo Sword Sect disciple,
Nascent Transformation Late Stage)
How strong is it?

177
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,260
Not weaker than Master’s sword.

178
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,660
(Mo Fei, Demon General,
Nascent Transformation Great Perfection)

179
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,350
(That direction…)

180
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,950
(Flood Prison…)

181
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,590
(Imperial Sword…)

182
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,550
(Could the Imperial Sword be after Wang Lin?)

183
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,230
(With Wang Lin’s cultivation,)

184
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,510
(how could he draw the Sword itself?)

185
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,950
(I must be overthinking it.)

186
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,990
If you want to live, don’t go that way.

187
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,350
Stay close to me.

188
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,470
(This mess is way too big now.)

189
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,550
(How did this guy even lure the Sword?)

190
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,390
(If he gets caught,)

191
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,350
(I’ll surely be dragged down too.)

192
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,730
Move, quickly.

193
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,750
Do not forget our agreement.

194
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,590
Is there a place to seclude myself?

195
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,830
Come with me.

196
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,400
Many thanks.

197
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,510
(It really is him.)

198
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,900
(Five days later)

199
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,470
Three thousand seven hundred ninety‑two
strands of Slaughter Aura

200
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,270
have been formed.
