1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,920
Gentlemen.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,920
If you don't mind,

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,480
let me offer you some advice.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,600
Master Guan, the chief of Guanzhong Disciplinary Hall,

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
please come to our hall in Xuzhou

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,640
for a cup of tea.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,440
We're not even sure if we can leave the Guixiang Pavilion now.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,780
We'll try our best to clear your names

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,360
and reveal the truth behind the Luo family massacre.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,600
Take this sword and blade back.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,400
But remember,

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,880
you owe me a favor.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,240
You must be Xuanyuan Guang.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
Today,

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,560
let's see which one of us is better.

16
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,600
We don't need to compete.

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,130
How could I be a match for the legendary thief?

18
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,280
Before this feather touches the ground,

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
if I can't pluck a single hair from your head,

20
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,160
I'll admit defeat.

21
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,370
The feather has landed!

22
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,160
Ming Hong truly lives up to his reputation.

23
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,810
You're too kind.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,930
You're too kind.

25
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,200
Young Master Xuanyuan,

26
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,720
you should depart soon.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,920
Gentlemen,

28
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
until we meet again.

29
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,120
Wait a moment.

30
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Although I haven't joined your gang,

31
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
we're in the same boat.

32
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,600
There's something I'd like to ask you.

33
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,520
Please go ahead.

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,250
Earlier at Guixiang Pavilion,

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
a young lady mentioned that

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,800
your gang knows something about my master.

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,600
You're referring to the cause of your master's death, right?

38
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,120
Please share what you know.

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,280
Your master's wounds were very unusual.

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,080
The only techniques that could cause such wounds,

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,800
apart from the Hainan Wild Wind Sword Technique

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,560
and the Tianshan 72 Sword Arts,

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,120
there's another little-known martial art.

44
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
What martial art?

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,320
Kunlun Divine Art.

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
The Demonic Cult?

47
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,800
Exactly.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
I don't know much about it either.

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
After you join the Heroes' Gang,

50
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,290
you can ask the leader personally.

51
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,960
May I ask who your gang's leader is?

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,640
You'll meet him in due time.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Let's go.

54
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,120
Xuanyuan Guang is finally gone.

55
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,040
The moment I saw him,

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,900
I clutched my money pouch tightly

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,340
and kept at least five feet away from him the whole time.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Otherwise...

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,680
Senior brother.

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,200
It's full of stones.

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,840
Check yours quickly!

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
Gentlemen,

63
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,040
your breakfast is ready.

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
Gentlemen,

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
that'll be 100 copper coins.

66
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
Young man,

67
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,680
my brother and I are a bit short on money these days.

68
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,540
Would it be possible to pay later?

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Please help us out.

70
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,040
We'll have money in a month

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,360
and will repay double.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,480
Junior brother.

73
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,800
Brother, it's time I taught you

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,840
some survival skills for the jianghu.

75
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,360
Today,

76
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,920
we'll use the martial arts our master taught us

77
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,000
to earn ourselves a meal

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,680
and broaden your horizons.

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,600
Step one of jianghu survival:

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
choose the right location.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,440
For a wandering performer to make a living with their skills,

82
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,900
they must choose remote villages and towns.

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
The locals here haven't seen much

84
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,280
of the traveling performers and their tricks.

85
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,010
Even a simple forward roll will get you applause.

86
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
Senior brother,

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,960
what are you doing?

88
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,000
Step two of survival in the jianghu:

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
follow the scent.

90
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,040
Walk through the streets at mealtime

91
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,440
and smell the food aromas wafting through the air.

92
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,480
You can roughly determine how wealthy the residents are

93
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,440
and find a street with rich households to set up shop.

94
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
That's brilliant, senior brother!

95
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,020
This place is good.

96
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,400
I can smell wine.

97
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,040
These people are rolling in money!

98
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Senior brother,

99
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,040
what's step three?

100
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,780
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,440
My brother and I have just arrived in your fine town

102
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,520
and know no one here.

103
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
Today we'll demonstrate authentic

104
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,520
Southern Five-Form Transformation Boxing

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,200
for your entertainment.

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,720
Those with money can show appreciation with coins,

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,760
those without can show appreciation with applause!

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,280
I, Zheng Da, am here

109
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
and thank you all in advance!

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,400
Junior brother,

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,200
after I finish the routine,

112
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
you go around collecting money.

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,040
Senior brother,

114
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,520
what routine are you performing?

115
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,160
Just the Five Animal Exercises.

116
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,820
Even my father knows that one.

117
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,900
Here's something for you.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,920
Thank you.

119
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,840
Senior brother,

120
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,640
we've made our first money!

121
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Look at this!

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,280
People really aren't as generous as they used to be.

123
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,320
Ten years ago when I first started performing,

124
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,080
one routine would earn me thirty or forty copper coins.

125
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
People's tastes have become so refined nowadays.

126
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Thank you all for your generosity

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,200
in providing my brother and me with enough for a meal.

128
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,360
I wonder if you all

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,800
would like to see some other tricks

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,480
and perhaps reward us with enough for a pot of wine?

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,140
Breaking stones on the chest!

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,960
Eighty copper coins!

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Good!

134
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,640
Yes!

135
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,960
Let's see that!

136
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Do that one!

137
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,280
Let's have that!

138
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,210
Senior brother,

139
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,220
can you do that?

140
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,520
As long as your body is strong enough,

141
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,450
anyone can do it.

142
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,080
Since everyone wants to see this feat of iron body qigong,

143
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,720
this ultimate skill,

144
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
how could I refuse?

145
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,920
Please be patient,

146
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,400
while my brother and I make some preparations.

147
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,560
I'll keep the crowd entertained here.

148
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,360
Take the money

149
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,040
and quickly buy a rectangular stone and an iron hammer.

150
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,800
Senior brother,

151
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,720
where do I buy those things?

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,280
Step four of survival in the jianghu:

153
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,680
adapt to circumstances.

154
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
What can I help you with, sir?

155
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,120
Greetings, good sir.

156
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,440
My brother and I are passing through your town

157
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,120
hoping to earn a meal by performing.

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,760
Now we want to perform

159
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,890
the stone-breaking feat on the chest.

160
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,120
I wonder

161
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,320
if I could borrow that rectangular stone from your residence?

162
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,720
Sir, you must be joking.

163
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,000
This Taihu Diamond Stone

164
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,520
has already been sealed by imperial order.

165
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,920
They say it's to be used in the imperial gardens in Chang'an.

166
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,640
Even if I had the greatest courage,

167
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,600
I wouldn't dare lend it to you.

168
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
I see.

169
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,920
This stone truly brings misfortune.

170
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,320
The imperial messenger deliberately sealed this stone

171
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,720
forcing my family to spend money day and night to maintain it.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,660
All because he coveted my 'Turtle and Crane Longevity' painting.

173
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,720
Sir,

174
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,940
may I take a look at that painting?

175
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,800
It's been so long and still nothing.

176
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,440
Pay me back!

177
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm leaving.

178
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,650
How long has it been?

179
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,880
Are you trying to cheat a child out of money?

180
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,320
Everyone,

181
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,640
if you're feeling bored,

182
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,770
allow me, Zheng Da, to tell you a story.

183
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

184
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,380
there was once a great warrior from the south

185
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,320
who traveled a long distance with his apprentice.

186
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,120
They were heading to Lingnan to establish a martial arts school

187
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,050
but encountered a great disaster.

188
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,160
He was severely wounded

189
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,960
and no doctor dared to treat him.

190
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,960
Just when he and his apprentice were in trouble,

191
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,840
they met a stunningly beautiful woman.

192
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,800
A forgery.

193
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,250
That's impossible.

194
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,840
In the authentic Zu-style 'Turtle and Crane Longevity',

195
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,200
the crane is always soaring freely beyond the sky.

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Therefore, the painting only shows the turtle

197
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,930
and never the crane.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,160
I see now.

199
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,720
No wonder General Cao of the Left Guard

200
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,920
also said this painting was a convincing fake.

201
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I've made a terrible mistake.

202
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,960
Sir, you are truly talented.

203
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,080
I am a merchant from Xuzhou,

204
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,840
Bo Tinggui.

205
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,840
May I ask your esteemed name?

206
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,520
I am

207
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,000
Zu Beiqiu from Yizhou.

208
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
Master Zu!

209
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
It must be you!

210
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
This discerning eye,

211
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,360
this eloquence,

212
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,840
this calm and composed demeanor.

213
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,840
You must be the one as famous as Lord Cao, known as

214
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,800
'Zu of the Southern Turtle.'

215
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,800
I never thought that today

216
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,560
I would actually meet you in person.

217
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
You flatter me.

218
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,800
Master,

219
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,120
would you honor me with two of your ink treasures?

220
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
First, to solve my urgent problem,

221
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,920
and second, to fulfill my lifelong wish.

222
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,640
If I could witness your painting skills with my own eyes,

223
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,960
not only would I offer this diamond stone,

224
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,520
but I would also present you with a thousand taels of gold.

225
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,760
The warrior was startled by these words

226
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
and replied,

227
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,400
'She doesn't know any healing techniques.

228
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,360
The one who treated my wounds

229
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
was her husband.'

230
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Senior brother!

231
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm back!

232
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
Just for a few copper coins,

233
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,080
you hired so many people.

234
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,840
As expected from someone whose family owns a bank.

235
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,520
Senior brother,

236
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,640
lie down here.

237
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,300
This bench is more comfortable than the ground.

238
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,120
Advanced.

239
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Junior,

240
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,280
you know how to care for others now.

241
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,720
Senior, please wait a moment.

242
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,180
Something good is coming.

243
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,640
Junior,

244
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,100
what kind of stone is this?

245
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,520
Benefactor.

246
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
Big hammer.

247
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,170
Benefactor,

248
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
smash this cursed thing

249
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,040
and be done with it.

250
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Old man,

251
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,560
just watch.

252
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,600
80.

253
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,000
80.

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,000
80.

255
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,880
80.

256
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,320
80.

257
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,080
80.

258
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,520
80.

259
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
80.

260
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,080
80.

261
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,680
80.

262
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,040
80.

263
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,520
80.

264
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,480
80.

265
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:52,880
80.

266
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,000
Dongting.

267
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,720
In life,

268
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,520
you will face many challenges.

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
This wooden knife is old.

270
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,720
You can have it.

271
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,320
To strengthen yourself through hardship,

272
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
you must have a strong heart.

273
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,530
Ten years later.

274
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,240
You will be powerful enough to conquer the world.

275
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,400
I beg you.

276
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,200
I swear I will never use the martial arts of the Seven Sects and Eight Schools,

277
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,060
just let me keep my Swallow Flying Cloud technique.

278
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,040
If I break my oath,

279
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,050
the heroes of the martial world

280
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
shall put me to death.

281
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,840
Junior,

282
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,420
did you find anything?

283
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,640
I checked all the hiding places we agreed on,

284
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,700
but found nothing.

285
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Same here.

286
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,080
I noticed these hiding spots

287
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,610
have already been searched

288
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,320
very thoroughly.

289
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,680
So,

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,930
someone already has the evidence.

291
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
That's right.

292
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,000
But this person

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
didn't give it to Master Guan.

294
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,970
Could they have figured it out?

295
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,600
If they had,

296
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,480
they would have exposed it already.

297
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
They want to conceal the killer's identity.

298
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,080
Why?

299
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,090
If those people killed the entire Luo family,

300
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,280
he would eventually have to confront them for justice,

301
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,040
but he doesn't have the courage.

302
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
He wants fame

303
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,880
but also values his life.

304
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,480
What a greedy person.

305
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,200
Now

306
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,200
we can only create new evidence

307
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
to save them.

308
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,560
If we do that,

309
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
it will certainly make that person suspicious

310
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
and everything will be exposed.

311
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,160
We can't worry about that now.

312
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,290
Let's clear Brother Zheng and Brother Zu's names first.

313
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,560
Senior,

314
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,240
you're awake.

315
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,920
Our performance was quite successful.

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,860
We earned a whole string of coins.

317
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,400
Brother.

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,560
Where did you get this stone from?

319
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,400
It's quite extraordinary.

320
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Of course it is.

321
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
This stone

322
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,400
is worth a fortune.

323
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,160
Brother.

324
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
When the stone broke,

325
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,320
everyone cheered.

326
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,360
Many were so moved they cried.

327
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,600
I met a wealthy merchant who wanted paintings.

328
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,860
I traded two longevity paintings for it.

329
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,920
He even offered me a thousand gold taels.

330
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,680
He was already in desperate need.

331
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,840
How could I

332
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,240
take more money from him?

333
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,600
You idiot!

334
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,240
What are we performing for?

335
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,560
To learn

336
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,020
and survive in this world.

337
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,640
I've learned plenty.

338
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,600
Brother.

339
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,920
Seeing you so happy,

340
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,520
I have more good news.

341
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,600
We've become famous.

342
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,800
Many boatmen told me

343
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,000
they'll spread our names everywhere.

344
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,120
You didn't tell them your real name, did you?

345
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,480
Of course I mentioned your name first.

346
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
Mine came after yours.

347
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,600
Brother.

348
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,760
There's a fifth step to surviving in this world.

349
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,200
While I'm still alive,

350
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,280
let me teach you everything.

351
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,440
Brother,

352
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,080
tell me.

353
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,960
In everything you do,

354
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,560
you must think ahead.

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,760
Now think carefully.

356
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,480
After we've become famous in this town,

357
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,360
what will happen next?

358
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
I can't figure it out.

359
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,210
Can't think and can't hear either?

360
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,080
'Capture Zu Beiqiu alive!

361
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,410
Seize Zheng Dongting!'

362
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,290
'Arrest the two villains of the Central Plains!'

363
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,640
Brother.

364
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,200
You should run.

365
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,160
I plan to kill the prisoners with my Lion's Roar

366
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,760
and escape from this prison.

367
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
What do you think?

368
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,800
Since Master Duan is in the mood,

369
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,730
I'll play along.

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,960
'Heavenly fragrance stains clothes at night.'

371
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,240
'National beauty intoxicates the morning wine.'

372
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,000
'Only the peony has true national beauty.'

373
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,200
'Peach blossoms are indeed bewitching,

374
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,000
making my heart itch with desire.'

375
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Now about chrysanthemums...

376
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,560
Who goes there?

377
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,960
Haven't we met somewhere before?

378
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,040
'One night of stars and rivers.'

379
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,440
'Falling from the western sky.'

380
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,520
Elder Wang.

381
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,400
Something's happened.

382
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,124
