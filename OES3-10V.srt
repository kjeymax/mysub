Wang Xi failed

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,230
You killed him

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,910
He died in the Eight Trigrams Formation

41
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,370
He brought his own destruction

42
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,150
Wang Xi was truly talented

43
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,750
He shouldn't have died so pitifully

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,410
He died because of you

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,450
No, it was because of the Blade Demon

46
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,370
If not for the Blade Demon

47
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,150
My father wouldn't have died

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,550
If my father hadn't died

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,870
Ram Gang wouldn't be in this state today

50
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,030
All the blood, all the debts

51
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,950
Must be counted on the Blade Demon's head

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,390
You and your master deserve to die

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,650
Every cause has its effect

54
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,550
(Jiyang City · Eight Trigrams Formation · Deadly Spot)
If your father hadn't killed for treasure

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,350
How would he have died by my master's blade

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,430
Ridiculous

57
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,590
Ram Gang already had immense wealth

58
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,950
Our training ground is paved with gold bricks

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,670
Why would we steal the Yi Tribe's worthless junk

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,470
A father's murder is an unforgivable feud

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,710
He Fangzhi

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,190
Today, either you die or I perish

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,890
I won't perish

64
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,200
Only you will die

65
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,430
Turning back from a wrong path is wise

66
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,210
Only after right and wrong comes understanding

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,510
A prodigal's return is worth more than gold

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,350
It's not too late to stop at the edge

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,390
He Fangzhi

70
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,470
You were raised by the Blade Demon

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,430
You can't tell right from wrong

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,750
You've committed many evil deeds

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,030
You should be beyond forgiveness

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,470
But the righteous path shines bright

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,150
You deserve a chance to turn to the light

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,790
If you help me kill the Blade Demon

77
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,830
We will let the past go

78
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,390
You can still be seen as a fellow martial artist

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,230
You came for the treasure too, didn't you

80
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,870
I only wish, for all martial artists

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,190
To seek justice from the Blade Demon

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,590
Life's journey is full of turmoil

The shore is right behind you

86
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,900
Why not turn back

87
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,550
Trust me

88
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,150
Tell me where Jiang Feng is hiding

89

And the whereabouts of the Crimson Sand Treasure

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,770
I only believe those killed by my master's blade

91
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,400
Were all people who deserved to die

92
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,110
Ridiculous

93
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,020
Even my eleven-year-old nephew deserved to die

94
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,390
Jiang Feng slaughtered Ancient Sword Villa years ago

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,990

102
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,360
I traveled day and night

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,710
To return and join my brother and sister-in-law

104

To rid the martial world of evil

105

None survived

108

All these years, I swore to avenge my brother's family

109
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,350
Why are you laughing, you drunkard

110
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,790
I'm laughing

111
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,480
What am I laughing at

112
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,010
I just remembered

113
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,350
I'm laughing at someone talking nonsense

114
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,550
What nonsense are you spouting, drunkard

115
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,630
Talk nonsense too much

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,430
You probably can't understand real words

117

You're an accomplice of the Blade Demon

Why are there so many injuries

The Ram Gang rules the Central Plains,
their numbers are strong.

150

We've seen Leader Guo Changyuan's blade skills.

153
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,220
I saw it with my own eyes.

he killed Leader Guo.

157
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,630
What did the swordsman look like?

158
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,150
He wore wolf fangs.

159
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,430
There were totems on his clothes.

160
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,530
He looked like a Crimson Sand tribesman.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,780
Impossible.

162

My parents' Jian Die Twin Sword Technique
isn't afraid of that.

Every family has its own grudges.

A great gang leader slain with one strike—

165
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,950
this has shocked many in the martial world.

166

Master, you should seize this chance.

167
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,710
What chance?

168
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,150
Wait for that swordsman to cause a bloodbath.

169
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,900
First, the martial world is wounded.

170
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,070
Second, he himself is weakened.

171
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,390
Then Ancient Sword Villa's Jian Die Twin Swords
strike again.

172
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,750
Ancient Sword Villa's fame will soar.

173
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,510
We can attract more martial artists.

174
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,110
No.

175
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,950
Ancient Sword Villa can't ignore righteousness.

176
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,110
Brother and sister-in-law want to act now.

177
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,590
Jian Die Twin Swords against a broken blade—

178
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,920
that's no problem at all.

179
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,580
You—

180
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,910
Lan Yu.

181
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,050
What's wrong with you today?

182
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,070
You're usually gentle and humble.

183
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,310
Gentle and humble?

184
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,790
If you hadn't listened to a woman's words,

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,790
you'd be digging and planting all day.

186
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,910
You're basically the Xu family's hired hand.

187
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,190
And you even call her the manor master.

188
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,630
Ancient Sword Villa would be famous by now.

189
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,590
Even old Guo Changyuan would come
begging to celebrate my birthday.

190
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,070
Ancient Sword Villa's Liu Pingjun and Xu Xunyin—

191
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,470
he is that swordsman.

192
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,650
Guo Changyuan is dead.

Wang Hanqing is dead.

Twenty more to go.

195
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,950
Let this slaughter end with us, husband and wife.

The essence of twin swords is Taiji.

199

Yin and yang give birth to each other.

200
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,580
Twin swords flow like water.

201
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,310
Can you cut water?

202
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,470
I've done it.

203
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,790
If the blade is fast enough,

204
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,660
it can cut water.

Spare my son.

Stop! I will kill you.

Uncle Lan Yu, he killed my parents.

216

I want to be the master of Ancient Sword Villa.

220

I want everyone to kill the bad guys.

Let the whole family leave together.

you're just an old turtle flailing in the mud.

245

And you dare call it Jian Die Sword?

246

Why do you seek death yourself?

yet never cut off the enemy's head.

A broken body burned by fire.

Deep.

Help you pass through this Eight Trigrams Formation.

262

Your parents knew their own faults.

263

They faced death bravely.

264
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,750
They only hoped you'd live well.

265

Why do you cling to this obsession?

266
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,110
My parents were known for their integrity.

267

They did no wrong.

268

He Fangzhi has only a fraction
of the Blade Demon's power.
