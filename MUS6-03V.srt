(Previously on)
Kid, what gives you the right to snatch it?

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,350
Do you even know what "first come, first served" means?

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,300
Only the capable can claim the treasure.

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,350
Life-Death Cycle Pill

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,840
I'll be taking it.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,240
Kid

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,960
Stop chasing.

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,180
That pill furnace is shrouded in the power of death.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,640
Xiao Yan

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,600
Come with me.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,950
None of you will get the Life-Death Cycle Pill.

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,350
That kid is really crazy.

49
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,120
Kid

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,310
Were you trying to get yourself killed just now?

51
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,830
If not for the Stone Talisman protecting you,

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,640
you...

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,710
I promised you

54
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,710
I'd help you get your body back.

55
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,790
Where is this place?

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,910
(Tian Gang Alliance)
We'd better be careful.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,710
I bet the Tian Gang Alliance's ruins

58
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,990
aren't this simple.

59
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,720
The entrance...

60
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,880
is gone.

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Help me!

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,230
Those spirits are...

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,300
Episode 03
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Run!

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,670
Elder Brother!

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
Up ahead!

67
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,100
This...

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,560
Are you kidding me?

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,600
Kid

70
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,160
Over there!

71
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,350
Go!

72
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
That was way too close.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,640
Get out of the way!

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,000
Leave here, now!

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,750
This is way too intense.

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,880
Darn it.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,870
It's a dead end.

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,200
Like this, we...

79
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,710
can't hold out much longer.

80
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,830
Don't worry, Elder Brother, Second Brother.

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,150
I can still hang in there.

82
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,710
What's happening this time?

83
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,230
Looks like...

84
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,990
there shouldn't be any danger here.

85
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,150
What's going on?

86
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,080
Here...

87
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,630
Why are there so many statues here?

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,070
These stone figures are really well made.

89
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,910
No idea who made them.

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,560
Silly Tiger

91
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,750
These stone figures

92
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,990
weren't crafted.

93
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Could it be...

94
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,310
these were once living people?

95
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,310
These stone figures

96
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,470
have been here for at least a thousand years.

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,150
Maybe they're disciples of this sect.

98
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,150
How did they all end up like this?

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,230
That, I don't know.

100
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,990
Maybe it's some kind of curse.

101
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,350
- Or maybe a forbidden ritual.
- Disciples of Ba Ji Sect.

102
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,790
Protect the sect.

103
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,680
Even if it means perishing together.

104
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,030
- Defend to the death.
- At any cost.

105
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,030
Slay all Abyssal Demons.

106
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,950
- Protect heaven and earth.
- Even if it means perishing together.

107
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,150
At any cost.

108
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,400
Even if it means perishing together.

109
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,510
- Protect heaven and earth.
- Disciples of Ba Ji Sect.

110
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,630
- Defend to the death.
- Protect the sect.

111
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,350
Slay all Abyssal Demons.

112
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,470
Disciples of Ba Ji Sect.

113
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,320
Protect heaven and earth.

114
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,260
Protect the sect.

115
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,440
Even if it means perishing together.

116
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,550
- At any cost.
- Disciples of Ba Ji Sect.

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,720
- Maybe...
- Protect the sect.

118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,430
It's related to the formation in these ruins.

119
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,270
Kid

120
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,120
What's wrong with you?

121
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
You guys...

122
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,950
Did you hear someone talking?

123
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,710
Talking?

124
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,270
Only Second Brother was talking just now.

125
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
You silly tiger.

126
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,370
Kid

127
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,160
Did you hear what was said clearly?

128
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,600
It's like...

129
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,990
there are many voices.

130
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,670
Can't make out what they're saying.

131
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
Maybe...

132
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,030
it's the lingering spiritual will of these people.

133
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
Kid

134
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,150
Try using your spiritual power

135
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,320
to probe this place.

136
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
(Tian Gang Alliance)

137
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:16,710
Elder Brother

138
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
How are you?

139
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,190
My spiritual power

140
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,030
has connected with these stone figures.

141
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,110
has formed a link.

142
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,350
Kid

143
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,290
What did you see?

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,160
I saw...

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,790
this is the Ba Ji Sect.

146
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,990
And what these disciples were fighting against

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,830
is the same as the monsters we saw in the Great Wilderness Ancient Stele.

148
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
They're the same.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,610
Is there more?

150
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,920
There is.

151
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,270
That red array

152
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,110
and the massive stone gate—

153
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,270
I think I know where the formation core is.

154
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,200
Let's go.

155
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,990
It's right here.

156
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,920
That one—

157
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,880
should be the formation core.

158
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,990
These people—

159
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,030
they sacrificed themselves to this array.

160
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,240
What kind of array

161
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,670
could be so cruel?

162
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,430
This is—

163
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,060
the Nirvana Sky-Burning Array.

164
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,430
Sky-Burning Array...

165
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,130
Nirvana Sky-Burning Array.

166
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,150
Once activated,

167
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,070
it burns everything to ashes.

168
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,710
These disciples

169
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,310
must have been ready to die

170
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,030
when they triggered this array.

171
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,710
Even if it meant perishing together,

172
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,070
they protected the world.

173
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,070
That person—

174
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,950
must have turned himself into the formation core.

175
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,760
If we break that stone figure,

176
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,590
we should

177
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,190
be able to undo the array here.

178
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,230
It's time for these Ba Ji Sect disciples

179
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,550
to be freed.

180
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,160
How could this be?

181
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,270
Elder Brother—

182
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,120
Let me give it a try.

183
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,950
Maybe brute force

184
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,100
will work better.

185
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Looks like this array

186
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,470
was never meant to be undone.

187
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,080
Xiao Yan!

188
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Step back, quick!

189
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
This—

190
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,910
is the first time I've felt heat.

191
00:13:35,934 --> 00:14:05,134
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

192
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,330
This—

193
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,350
Stone Talisman actually

194
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,310
has this kind of power?

195
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,160
Don't look at Master Marten.

196
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,990
Master Marten doesn't know all the Stone Talisman's powers.

197
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,830
But it seems

198
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,110
the Stone Talisman might

199
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,710
unlock the Sky-Burning Array's core.

200
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,480
Sorry about this.

201
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,830
Looks like the Nirvana Sky-Burning Array

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,070
is finally broken.

203
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,750
Let's go.

204
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,550
Let's see what's beyond the gate.

205
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,560
Kid—

206
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,270
Trouble's coming again.

207
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,750
To break the array here—

208
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,030
Brother Lin Dong, you truly are skilled.

209
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,920
Brother Mu Sha—

210
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,670
Is this how you seize treasures?

211
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,030
That's right.

212
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,710
Treasure hunting is all about skill.

213
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,150
Those words—

214
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,070
were spoken by Brother Lin Dong himself.

215
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,390
I'm afraid you alone

216
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,910
can't handle the two of us.

217
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,270
Seems I've been

218
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,990
underestimated by Brother Lin Dong.

219
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,160
Now—

220
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,030
let me show you

221
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,710
the true power of a You Quan Dynasty Celestial Rune Master.

222
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,270
my real skills.

223
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,470
This guy—

224
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,910
can control those stone statues!

225
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,430
That's the Spirit Driving Technique.

226
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,590
Die!

227
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,440
Watch out!

228
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,400
The techniques of these statues

229
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,310
are no joke.

230
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,390
Let's see how long you last.

231
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,710
Lin Dong!

232
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,510
Find a way to deal with the caster first!

233
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,360
Xiao Yan!

234
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,950
Kid—

235
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,710
You think a sneak attack can beat me?

236
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,280
As expected—

237
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,310
you can only use one mental power at a time.

238
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,120
Jerk!

239
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,750
Wind-Thunder Seal!

240
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,620
Thunder!

241
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,670
I won't let you control those statues again!

242
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,590
Darn it!

243
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,350
What's going on?

244
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,630
What kind of beast is that?

245
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,510
It should be a Primordial Demon Dragon Dog.

246
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,550
I'm afraid—

247
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,270
it's the guardian beast of this sect.

248
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,750
Why did it suddenly awaken?

249
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,950
The array's removal must have released it.

250
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,990
But now, this beast

251
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,390
is just a corpse.

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,950
What keeps it moving

253
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,110
is only a fragment of its soul inside.

254
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,200
You mean—

255
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,430
it's dead?

256
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,470
Heaven truly helps me!

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,840
Darn it, this is bad!

258
00:20:36,864 --> 00:21:00,564
