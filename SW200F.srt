29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,370
(Previously on Swallowed Star)
Such astonishing speed,

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,130
and formidable strength.

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,370
His power is enough

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,480
to be worthy of a heavy treasure.

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,870
(I didn't expect that in the six thousand years
I was gone,)

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,810
(power would be eroded this much.)

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,080
All immigrants and Earth's native residents

Episode 200
[Ice Prison Planet]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,760
My lord,

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,760
(Planet Magshow)
we've never met before.

45
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,840
I don't know how I have offended you.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,750
Please, enlighten me.

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,660
(Those servants who have seen me
in such a sorry state,)

48
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,510
(if I escape this ordeal,)

49
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,230
(I'll kill them all.)

50
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,930
Luo Feng! Kill him!

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,490
You know how to behave.

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,720
But sadly,

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,300
no matter how you struggle,

54
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,320
you will die.

55
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
I...

56
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,770
Demon Emperor!

57
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,120
Give me a reason.

58
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,800
Soaring Shuttle!

59
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,290
Luo Feng, let me out.

60
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,540
I want to watch him die.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,610
And this artificial life...

62
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,780
You are on Huyan Bo's side.

63
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,440
(Evolution Heart)

64
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,920
(is a Mechanism race treasure.)

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,150
(It can grant a body to an artificial life.)

66
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,560
(Barbata will also have the chance
to cultivate and evolve.)

67
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,950
(But most importantly,)

68
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,490
(it gives Barbata the chance to take revenge
with her own hands.)

69
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,040
It's done.

70
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,180
Master,

71
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,470
did you see that?

72
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,510
King Magshow is dead.

73
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,280
He's dead.

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,190
Back then you entrusted me to keep your legacy.

75
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,420
I never dared tell Luo Feng who your enemy was.

76
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,760
I never imagined this day of vengeance
would come.

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,870
It's okay to cry.

78
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,440
Stay as long as you need

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,880
to sort out your feelings.

80
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,250
(Uhoa Realm)

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,340
(The Ice Prison Planet Belt)

82
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,320
(hosts a special lifeform that has existed)

83
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,950
(since the universe's birth)

84
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,140
(named the “Doko.”)

85
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,220
(They are beautiful in appearance,)

86
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,760
(innocent by nature,)

87
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,730
(but murderous.)

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,870
(According to VUC records,)

89
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,080
(three meters tall)
(they are loving and united internally,)

90
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,220
(beautiful)
(but extremely xenophobic.)

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,980
(Born under an innate icy aura,
they are naturally)

92
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,560
(a hundred times stronger than humans.)

93
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,810
(According to the directions,)

94
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,220
(the third black metal plate)

95
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,680
(is located in the Ice Prison Planet Belt
of the Uhoa Realm.)

96
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,940
(What I must do)

97
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,900
(is to find it among the many
ice prison planets)

98
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,740
(and take it away.)

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,570
- Tienson.
- Here.

100
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,920
I need to pick, from your servants,

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,440
someone agile and quick.

102
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,450
Master.

103
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,410
From now on,

104
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,240
you will obey my master's commands.

105
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
Yes, yes.

106
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,090
Master's master.

107
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,760
Coordinates have been sent to you.

108
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,950
Remember,

109
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,570
you must keep the micro-detector active
at all times,

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,060
hide your whereabouts,

111
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,320
and avoid being discovered.

112
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,640
So cold.

113
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,230
Master's master told me to find
some black metal plate,

114
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,860
but where exactly is it hidden?

115
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,930
Sister,

116
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,590
we haven't seen any new ice sculptures
in a long time.

117
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,090
I guess there'll be another unlucky soul soon.

118
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,860
They came out from inside.

119
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,470
Moro Monkey, go take a look.

120
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,920
(There's actually a palace)

121
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,090
(within the planet.)

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,500
Such overwhelming pressure...

123
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,620
There's a terrifying powerhouse inside.

124
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,280
Master's master,

125
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,450
what should I do?

126
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,380
Avoid the palace,

127
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,640
scan the entire planet.

128
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,010
(Ice Prison Planet)
Outside the palace,

129
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,230
the region is entirely made of ice.

130
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
It seems

131
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,950
the black metal plate

132
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,240
can only be inside the palace.

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,480
Enter the palace!

134
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,500
Yes.

135
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,940
Master's master,

136
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
I am in position.

137
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,970
This one?

138
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,590
No.

139
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,580
Not this.

140
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,980
That one?

141
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,640
No.

142
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,940
This one? Next.

143
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,070
Next one.

144
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,560
Which one?

145
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,300
No, no, no.

146
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,730
Alien!

147
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,680
(No Signal)

148
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,620
If I enter the inner hall,
I will be discovered.

149
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
If I don't enter,

150
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,330
I won't get the metal plate.

151
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,150
=Swallowed Star=
=Ice Prison Planet=

152
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,010
(Outside the Ice Prison Planet Palace)

153
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,950
Befa.

154
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,550
(Iawu)

155
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,680
You came to see that alien too?

156
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,690
Come on, let's go together.

157
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,980
(Inside the Ice Prison Planet Palace)

158
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,100
Teacher Terasa.

159
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,640
(Terasa)
Iawu, Befa, you're here.

160
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,230
Where is that alien?

161
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,530
These aliens

162
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,360
all want the Ice Prison Stone
and the Ice Prison Dew.

163
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,830
They overestimate themselves.

164
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,390
Look.

165
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,520
A moro monkey from the demon race,

166
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,200
roughly Marquis-level strength.

167
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,990
(So many of them.)

168
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,160
(Doko truly is ruthless.)

169
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,530
(Although she acts gentle towards
her own people.)

170
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,320
A moro monkey?

171
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,370
This is the first time I've seen one
in reality.

172
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,980
This thing is so ugly.

173
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,820
Befa, don't you agree?

174
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,000
Befa.

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,920
Befa?

176
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,390
(If she discovers who I really am...)

177
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,880
What's with you today?

178
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,260
You're totally out of it.

179
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,530
Is something bothering you?

180
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,370
What's wrong?

181
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,970
Not in a great mood.

182
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't want to talk about it.

183
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,360
Alright, don't force him to speak.

184
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,250
Stay here and keep him company.

185
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,100
I need to go to the virtual universe.

186
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,590
Befa, let's go to the Mystic Hall.

187
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,090
I'll pass.

188
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,660
I want to walk alone.

189
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,620
Then I'm off.

190
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,090
(Lucky,)

191
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,020

Befa?

195
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,920
Yeah.

196
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,920
What about it?

197
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,650
He was just in my hall earlier,

198
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,510
looking gloomy.

(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,110
I got it so easy.

201
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,770
As long as I fly out of Ice Prison Planet,

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,030
then accelerate to lightspeed,

203
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,320
I can escape without anyone knowing.

my sensing range.)

Terasa.

210
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,030
Chief, he stole...

211
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,000
I know. Leave everything to me.

212
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,710
(Luckily my Mosas avatar is immune
to soul attacks.)

213

Little one, you run fast.

214
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,850
But you can't escape my grasp.

215
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,260
This will take some effort.

216
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,100
Right there.

217
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,000
Greetings, My Lord.

218
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,810
No.

219

You got played.

220
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,040
Got it.

221
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,580
Impressive.

222
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,740
You actually toyed with a Cosmic Sage.

Look, look!

Chief, kill that alien!

227
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,270
He dared pretend to be me?!

228
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,560
He even held my hand.

229
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,390
The one pretending is already dead.

230
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,620
This is the mastermind.

231

Chiefs,

232
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,810
what should we do with this alien?

233
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,120
Naturally, he must be slowly tortured.

234
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,220
The Ice Prison is about to open again.

235
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,760
This alien is doomed.

236
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,470
It's a killing ground in there.

237
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,490
Once inside, it's worse than death.

238

(So that's the Ice Prison,)

239

(the most legendary place
in the entire Planet Belt.)

(Guarded by the Doko Sages,)

(And at the base of the tree trunk,)

254
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,910
(a bright blue glowing opening is the entrance)

(at 50 light-years away,)

260

(Earth's surface would receive)

(about 35 million joules per square meter.)
