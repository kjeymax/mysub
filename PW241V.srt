(Do not imitate in real life)

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
(Previously on...)
This is the Yuanmu Cauldron

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,480
Whoever can lift it

24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,320
will be granted a chance at the core inheritance

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,920
He is like my Tianjiao Ant clan

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,880
able to lift what far exceeds his own limits

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,600
The Immortal Scripture is the Tianjiao Ant clan's legacy

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,760
Once mastered, even heaven and earth cannot bury you

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,120
Undying, immortal

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,200
Countless ages

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,680
At last, I have met you

32
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,860
(In ancient times, at the start of the Luangu Era)

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,600
To resist the Foreign Realm

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,000
My beloved wife

35
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Our children have all fallen in battle

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
Now

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,560
I too will soon pass

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,390
Only this one child remains

39
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,410
Taken from his late mother's womb

40
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,440
I beg the heavens to show mercy

41
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,880
Willing to trade my life

42
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,560
for my child's survival

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,880
My child

44
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,360
Though born weak

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,440
he must inherit the Tianjiao Ants' courage and honor

46
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,960
Refine his body with his father's blood

47
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,200
When you are strong enough

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
you may begin the inheritance

49
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,920
and seek the Immortal Scripture

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,040
Before I depart

51
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,560
I gazed into my child's future across endless ages

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
Wishing to see him once more

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,680
And I saw you in the future as well

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
Therefore

55
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I will not punish you for trespassing

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,680
You are the Tianjiao Ant elder

57
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
What did you see?

58
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,220
(Xiangu Battlefield)

59
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
Ah

60
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,120
This is the Tianjiao Ant elder's memory

61
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,040
Are you warning me

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,600
about the most terrifying enemy to come?

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
(Not too dull)

64
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,840
(This aura...)

65
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,480
(It's the one who killed me in the river of time)

66
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,600
(The Tianjiao Ant elder was once entangled by him too)

67
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,220
(Chifeng Spear, Immortal King An Lan's immortal weapon)

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,880
(There is yet another)

69
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
(far stronger than the previous two)

70
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,840
(This is the Era-End Great Calamity battle)

71
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
The three supreme Foreign Realm warriors attacked together

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,600
and besieged the elder

73
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,920
Back then, we Ten Fierce matched the Xian Wang's power

74
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
slaying countless so-called immortals

75
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
but drew treacherous ambushes

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,400
Now, our descendants have forgotten the enemy's might

77
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,160
And those three still live today

78
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
They will return in force

79
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,560
The spear wielder is the most terrifying

80
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,880
He once broke through all the great worlds alone

81
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,000
slaughtering billions

82
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
I glimpsed the future

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
Saw my child and you fighting side by side

84
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,520
Saw you pursue the ultimate limit

85
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
Surpassing the strongest

86
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,840
You remind me of my younger self

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,440
So I warn you today

88
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,800
What was the outcome of that war?

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,240
Fate is hard to divine

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
I only saw the calamity you alone must face

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Greater than all Xiangu has endured

92
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,200
The darkest age is coming

93
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,640
Are you ready?

94
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,040
Are you afraid?

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
One day, the enemy will be defeated

96
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,040
What is there to fear?

97
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,240
But if one day

98
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
all heavens fall silent

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,360
and all worlds are mute

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,200
In the vastness of heaven and earth

101
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
only you walk alone

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,840
fighting the heavens alone

103
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,640
bearing the blood calamity alone

104
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,280
Battling from youth until your hair turns white

105
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,000
Your blood and spirit exhausted

106
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,760
Will you still fight on?

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,840
Is this my future?

108
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
What about the others?

109
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,360
Why am I the only one left?

110
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,250
I refuse to believe this is the future

111
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,640
I only believe all enemies must be destroyed

112
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,550
and rewrite the fate of ages

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,000
I saw two possible endings

114
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,210
What you saw was only one of them

115
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,480
Your fate is tied to many others

116
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,280
Countless destinies entwine around you

117
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
Overlapping and unclear

118
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,300
Even I cannot distinguish them

119
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
Elder

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,030
I want the Immortal Scripture

121
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,180
Alright

122
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,680
Back then, I did not obtain the full scripture

123
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,680
So I never reached perfection

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,360
(Immortal Peak)
I hope you reach Immortal Peak

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,240
and bring out the complete scripture

126
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,160
to one day achieve true immortality

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,240
leaving no regrets

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,040
By then, you will realize

129
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,680
the real battlefield is not the Nine Heavens Ten Earths

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,740
but something far beyond imagination

131
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
(Now)

132
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,630
Roar

133
00:08:48,654 --> 00:09:21,554
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

134
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,790
Hmph

135
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,490
Not very big

136
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,160
But quite grumpy when waking up

137
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,520
What's happening to me?

138
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,500
Did you find the Immortal Scripture?

139
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,600
I've got a lead.

140
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,520
But it's in a distant place.

141
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,230
Are you willing to come with me?

142
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,320
You want to trick This King into leaving with you.

143
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,860
Go or not, it's up to you.

144
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,080
Master the Immortal Scripture,

145
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,340
your body remains unbroken,

146
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,290
uncorrupted through endless calamities,

147
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,400
and can nurture your former spirit again.

148
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm not eager to share it.

149
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,680
Wait.

150
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,680
That's my family's scripture.

151
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,680
Don't think of keeping it all to yourself.

152
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
If that's the case,

153
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
This King will reluctantly go with you.

154
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,480
And see what this era is capable of.

155
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,400
Don't you want to know how I got the news?

156
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
No need to say more.

157
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,920
This King only needs to know the target's location.

158
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,120
(Half an hour ago)
If there's anything useful here,

159
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,320
you may take it.

160
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,840
Thank you, elder.

161
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,760
Elder.

162
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
Won't you acknowledge it?

163
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,960
No need.

164
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,720
Crying only dulls its edge.

165
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
My bloodline should stand tall and proud.

166
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,220
Alone, it holds up the ancient sky.

167
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
(Truly father and son.)

168
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,560
So many students have gone down.

169
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,920
What will be left for us when it's our turn?

170
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,800
The two elders guard it fiercely.

171
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,840
No one can get in.

172
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
Don't get too cocky.

173
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,720
There are many terrifying beasts outside.

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
Don't end up as someone's snack.

175
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,800
Impossible.

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,800
On the Xiangu Battlefield, there was a glorious Foreign Realm Blood Phoenix Lion.

177
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
After my siblings joined the battle, it vanished.

178
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,160
It must have been slain by them.

179
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,480
This King won't be any less.

180
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,520
Huang, is that on your shoulder...

181
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,760
the Tianjiao Ant?

182
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,840
It is This King.

183
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,520
Now leaving here with my mount.

184
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,400
Seeking fortune.

185
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,800
Hey, who's the mount?

186
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Huang, join my Immortal Academy.

187
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,040
It'll help you go further.

188
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,450
Open up new horizons.

189
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,010
I refuse.

190
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,980
Nonsense.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,560
He's already found his own path.

192
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,780
Doesn't need you at all.

193
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,850
Huang, your body is strong.

194
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,960
Best suited for the Way of the Present.

195
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,280
Join the Sacred Academy,

196
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,760
and you can read any scripture.

197
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,900
Still not interested.

198
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,640
Huang has walked the Body as the Seed path.

199
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,560
Why be bound by the Way of the Present?

200
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,480
Don't you already have the Lunar Jade Rabbit and the young Qilin?

201
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,600
That Qilin is sealed.

202
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,120
Can't be studied at all.

203
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,520
The outside world is way too enthusiastic.

204
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,920
Begging and shouting for people to come.

205
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,910
Hmph.

206
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
Don't forget,

207
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
you were once a battle servant of my Wang Clan.

208
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
(Wang Manglong, Void Dao Realm)
Descendant of the Ten Fierce.

209
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,120
Should belong to my Wang Clan.

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,840
Burp.

211
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,760
The last Tianjiao Ant in the world.

212
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,680
(Yuan Qing, peak Sever-Me Realm)
Must be well protected.

213
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,520
Longevity Clan

214
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,880
far more reliable than a kid who makes enemies everywhere.

215
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,400
(Yuan Qing is here too.)

216
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,240
(Still suspects Yuan Feng's death.)

217
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,920
(Came here just to block me.)

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,760
Young friend,

219
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,880
for the Tianjiao Ant's safety,

220
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,860
please let us keep it safe.

221

(Feng Yingluo, Feng Clan Elder, peak Sever-Me Realm)

222

Also,

223
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,720
about my missing brother and nephew,

224
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,640
I'll be asking you about them soon.

225
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,480
(Wang Clan, Feng Clan, Yuan Clan)

226
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,200
(All my enemies are here.)

227
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,430
(Ready to surround and kill me.)

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
Get lost!

229
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,120
Hahaha.

230
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,050
That's hilarious.

231
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,390
Huang and the Tianjiao Ant are protected by Tianshen Academy.

232
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,240
Why are you all so eager to interfere?

233
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,020
(Xu Mingxuan, Emperor of the Longevity Dynasty, father of Princess Yaoyue)

234
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,360
My apologies.

235
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,240
So it's Emperor Xu.

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,400
But the Tianjiao Ant is a serious matter.

237
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,600
Even if an elder arrives,

238
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,580
don't blame our three clans for not showing respect.

239
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,580
(Sever-Me Realm experts from Feng, Yuan, and Wang Clans)

240

(All are Sever-Me Realm.)

241
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,710
Elders, what do you mean by this?

242
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,010
For the sake of the academy,

243
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,400
the Tianjiao Ant's Blood of Strength's Limit is too important.

244
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,590
There's really no other way.

245
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,570
Afterwards,

246
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,950
Huang will be compensated.

247
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,960
(No way.)

(The Primordial True Scripture can't quickly reverse high-level Dao laws.)

(Should I risk manifesting the Great World or One Qi Transforms All Life?)

250

(I'll be at their mercy.)

252
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,520
Courting death!

253
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,120
How dare you disrespect This King!

254
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,840
Who dares to cause trouble in Tianshen Academy?

255
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,640
Great Elder

256
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,840
Emperor Xu arrives

257
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,600
Tianshen Academy should give a grand welcome

258
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,000
Hahaha

259
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,760
Great Elder, you flatter me

260
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,400
I've brought the treasure you requested

261
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,720
Your disciple is truly remarkable

262
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,120
Young in age, yet exceptionally gifted

263
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,760
Outshines many ancient sages

264
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,240
Emperor, you praise me too highly

265
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,280
Such terrifying pressure

266
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,400
Rumor says Meng Tianzheng is half a step from True Immortal

267
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,880

Hmph

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,800
Climbed to high places

270
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,020
And forgot your mine slave origins

271
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,080
You dare make a move

272
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,400
Aren't you afraid of the Wang Clan's revenge

273
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,360
Afraid? Hell no

274
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,480
Let Wang Clan's top ten geniuses come at me

275
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,180
I'll kill them all the same

276
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,360
(Is this person a Supreme Realm expert)

277
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,360
Haha

278
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,200
Punishing them myself is satisfying

279
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,780
But let me play the villain

280
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,080
Xu Mingxuan

281
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,960
You dare

282
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,720
Why wouldn't I dare

283
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,280
Is Wang Changsheng using this youngster's words

284
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,800
To reignite our ten-thousand-year feud

285
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,400
Senior, wise and mighty

286
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,480
Peerless in all the world

287
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,400
You just now descended like a god of slaughter

288
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,830
Now you're quite the flatterer

289
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,320
Little one

290
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,320
Why do you keep staring at me

291
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,360
Do we have a grudge

292
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,640
Why embroider a lizard, not an ant

293
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,520
This King is clearly more majestic

294
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
Hahaha

295
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,960
I know you're seeking fortune

296
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,960
Now no one should dare trouble you

297
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,480
Go on, then

298
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,560
Don't lose this ring
