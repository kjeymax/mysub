I'm Li Changshou,

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,020
a Blue Star native.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,620
With my master Qi Yuan's death,

35
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,560
I chose to fight the Tao of Heaven
to the end.

36
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,290
The trip to the Chaotic Sea
was truly full of twists and turns.

37
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,160
My conversation with Peng

38
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,860
ultimately raised everyone's suspicions
about me.

39
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,420
Luckily, I managed to
bluff my way through with nonsense.

40
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,160
Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu happened to return
to mourn for the Sect Master.

41
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,320
I caught up with her for a while.

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,020
After seeing her off,

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,990
I learned much about ancient history
from the Bold Notebook.

44
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,220
Later, I was attacked
by two outer-world demons.

Episode 117
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,060
Now...

47
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,260
let me take a look at your memories.

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,360
Go to the Duxian Sect
on the Dongshengshen Continent.

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Ask Taibai Jinxing

50
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,990
if he wants to see what comes next.

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,990
I understand.

52
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,760
Now I understand everything.

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,590
The reason why the outer-world demons
were able to enter the Primordial World,

54
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,190
or rather,

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,020
why the Tao of Heaven
and the Taoist Ancestor let them in,

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,760
allowing them to deliver a message
for Peng.

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,220
Shouldn't anything related
to Senior Bold

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
be a taboo for the Tao of Heaven?

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,860
Shouldn't it be erased?

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,660
There's

61
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,460
only one explanation for everything...

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,420
It's that Bold Notebook.

63
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,320
So, from that moment on,

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,220
the Tao of Heaven and Taoist Ancestor
already knew everything.

65
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,460
They've been

66
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,390
testing me all along.

67
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,290
First, tell me what you want to ask.

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,990
Let me give you a quote.

69
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,360
The relationship between Peng
and Senior Bold,

70
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,260
and whether Senior Bold truly
went mad in the end...

71
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,960
I won't charge you consulting fees
for these two answers.

72
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,860
Peng and he used each other,

73
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,720
but most of the time,

74
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,460
Peng was under his control.

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,560
As for the second question,

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,460
I cannot give you
a definitive answer either.

77
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,790
I know he had a plan to become a Sage,

78
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,160
but back then,
he suddenly moved the plan forward,

79
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,020
seeming impatient to obtain power
comparable to Sage Pangu's.

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Sage Pangu used a Heaven-Splitting Axe
to cleave heaven and earth apart,

81
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,590
slaying countless Innate Divine Demons
in the process.

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,190
To achieve that,

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,790
he did not hesitate
to wield Universe-origin power.

84
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,830
Had it not been for the Master
and the Tao of Heaven

85
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,590
suppressing him to death,

86
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,290
the Universe

87
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,460
would have ended long ago.

88
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,720
I always thought Senior Bold
was a good person, like me.

89
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,090
I never imagined he would
commit such atrocities.

90
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,520
No wonder the Taoist Ancestor
took action.

91
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,820
You'd better

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,560
be more careful in your actions
from now on.

93
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,660
Do not entertain
any treacherous thoughts.

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,220
Ah, Martial Aunt,

95
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,560
I've recently got something new...

96
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,960
I believe it might please you.

97
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,290
You've created a new comic?

98
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,760
What do you mean?

99
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,590
To be frank,

100
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,420
I accidentally obtained this
during my trip to the Chaotic Sea.

101
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,720
Because this notebook touches
on a taboo of the Tao of Heaven,

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,860
I wished to keep it from others,

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,760
but my curiosity got the better of me,

104
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,160
so I delved deep
into the Chaotic Sea to read it.

105
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,320
Unexpectedly, the notebook was filled
with utter nonsense.

106
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,120
I couldn't make head or tail of it.

107
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,090
I thought it was of little consequence,

108
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,660
but after your reminder,

109
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,160
I decided to hand it over.

110
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,860
After all, inviting trouble
over a madman's notebook

111
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,660
would be far too unworthy.

112
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,720
You are quite sensible.

113
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,660
Thank you for the praise.

114
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,790
Stop a single thought,
and all things revert to their origin.

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,860
Martial Aunt,

116
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,660
you mentioned that he suddenly
moved up his plan to become a Sage.

117
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,260
Was his rush

118
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,120
to compete with the Taoist Ancestor?

119
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
That question carries a separate price.

120
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,690
Are you truly sure you wish to know?

121
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,520
I've overstepped.

122
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,760
Your greatest virtue

123
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,160
is knowing exactly when to advance
and when to withdraw.

124
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,790
Keep drawing.

125
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,020
Make it more exciting.

126
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,590
I'm afraid that both the Taoist Ancestor
and Senior Bold back in the day...

127
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,060
weren't exactly clean.

128
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,360
The Taoist Ancestor and Tao of Heaven
may not share the same stance either.

129
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
And you...?

130
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,290
You've already stepped
into the Perfected Great Dao Realm

131
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,460
and mastered the Path of Balance.

132
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,990
You care so much about him...

133
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,820
Do you also wish to transcend
and become a Sage?

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,920
Transcendence has always been
on my mind,

135
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,820
but becoming a Sage...
let's forget that.

136
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,360
The current Universe
can no longer withstand

137
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,920
the impact
of a living being achieving Sagehood.

138
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,860
The more resources one occupies,

139
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,320
the greater the risks one must bear.

140
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,620
Excessive intervention in the Universe

141
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,090
brings inevitable backlash.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
So imprudent

143
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,690
and doomed to fail.

144
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,990
If you don't become a Sage,
how can you transcend?

145
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,690
Becoming a Sage is transcendence?

146
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,890
What exactly is your hometown like?

147
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,920
How is it that everyone from there
is more inscrutable than the last?

148
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
My hometown has plenty of excellent,

149
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,720
upstanding youths like me.

150
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,890
Of course,

151
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,390
few can remain as steadfast
as a great mountain,

152
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,860
the way I can.

153
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,460
I will find a way to deal with this.

154
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,190
But,

155
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,690
you obtained it from Peng, didn't you?

156
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,190
He kept sending outer-world demons lately
to lure me deep into the Chaotic Sea.

157
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,960
Do you plan to go?

158
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,760
Peng's speed pushes

159
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,790
the very limits
of the Primordial World's rules.

160
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,990
Why would I deliver myself
to his doorstep?

161
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,020
As for these outer-world demons,

162
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,260
they are the enemies of all
in the Primordial World.

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,020
I will kill every one I see.

164
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,790
I've made a two-step plan:

165
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,060
First, submit a memorial to His Majesty,

166
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,590
branding him a most-wanted criminal
across the Primordial World,

167
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,760
[Demon Master Peng]
shattering Peng's strategy
of feigning death.

168
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,190
Second, since Peng has always controlled
the outer-world demons.

169
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,790
I will launch a campaign
across the Three Thousand Worlds

170
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,660
and surrounding regions
to cleanse the outer-world demons,

171
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,560
and create a beautiful,
new Primordial World.

172
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,920
As for the outer-world demons' tendency
to possess human bodies,

173
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,920
Reincarnation Tower has a Divine Beast
just recovered from its injuries.

174
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,820
It might be time to take it for a walk,
world by world.

[Demon Lord]
Master, you're awake!

176
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,090
Thirty-five years...

177
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,360
A full thirty-five years!

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,260
Attack Xuandu City!

181
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,160
You must draw him out!

182
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,320
Yes, Master.

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,260
As expected of Junior Changgeng,

195
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,020
you've even managed to cozy up
to the outer-world demons.

196
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,420
Although Senior Taiyi's words are crude,

197
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,920
they are not entirely unreasonable.

198
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,220
Do you regret inviting Senior Taiyi

199

to guard Xuandu City now?

I'll say it again: withdraw!

You all, repair the formation here.

Leave the Demon Lord to me.

These past few days,

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,490
you've had quite the fun
assaulting Xuandu City.

224
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,920
Scum.

Envoys are not to be harmed
during the war!

Universe, return to one.

230
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,120
Third strike:

Explode!

233
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,760
The same ruler, in different hands...

234
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,490
makes such a vast difference!

235
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,060
Is this truly the Creation Jade Disc?

236
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,090
To be precise,

237
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,090
it's a fragment of it.

238
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,860
When Sage Pangu cleaved heaven
and earth apart,

239
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,190
the Creation Jade Disc was struck by it,

240
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,260
and a corner of it shattered
and broke away.

241
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,890
That fragment vanished
without a trace ever since.

242
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,820
The remaining was then
comprehended by the Taoist Ancestor,

243
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,920
thus becoming part of the Tao of Heaven.
