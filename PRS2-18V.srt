(Previously)
Lu Di lost Far East—

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,119
and even tried to kill the messenger
seeking help at Telan Fortress.

24
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,199
The Divine Race isn't just our Senea Tribe.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,919
For example, the Tarta Tribe.

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,079
Their strength is nearly equal to ours.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,919
This inevitably stirs those
who covet the Divine Emperor's throne—

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,119
they're starting to make moves.

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,719
I am willing to lead the Tarta forces—

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,239
to Far East, to quell the rebellion.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,279
This time—

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,719
the Tarta Tribe

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,799
is no longer a threat.

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,959
From today on, Lu Di

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,359
will be loyal to His Highness, King of Light.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,479
No betrayal, ever.

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,879
Who?

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,799
Zi Chuan Xiu.

(Telan Battle, Part 1)
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,279
Someone, help!

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,079
There's an assassin!

43
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,340
My lord!

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,220
Catch him—quick!

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,079
I didn't expect—

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,879
you're still alive.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,719
What?

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,919
Surprised?

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,959
A little.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,839
Don't look at me like that.

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,679
I won't kill you.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,319
Why should I trust you?

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,199
If I'd been at the door just now—

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,999
I’d probably

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,199
be in pieces by now.

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,559
My target was the King of Light,

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,759
not you, Zi Chuan Xiu.

58
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,279
Is His Highness, King of Light, alright?

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,599
Don't hide it from me.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,999
Only His Highness can teach
the Ripple Technique.

61
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,999
No one else can teach you.

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,399
Before I answer you—

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,279
you must answer me first.

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,039
Why do you have Blood Eye too?

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,559
Because—

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,999
we are the same kind.

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,799
I hate speaking in riddles.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,799
Can you be more direct?

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,519
His Highness is there.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,799
Gu Lei.

71
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,679
You arrived at just the right time.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,839
Let go, let go!

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,679
Let go, let go!

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,439
Release my lord!

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,399
If one day—

76
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,199
you find you have nowhere to go—

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,639
don't forget—

78
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,439
Zi Chuan isn't your only choice.

79
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,239
Lin He.

80
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,159
The Demon Race has sent 250,000 troops
to attack Far East.

81
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,879
Take care of yourself.

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,479
Da, da, da—

83
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,999
My lord!

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,799
You, you, you—

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,679
Are you alright?

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,439
Before you came—

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,879
I was fine.

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,559
Your Highness.

89
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,159
Governor, what are you doing?

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,799
You sure have the mood to eat and drink.

91
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,719
No matter how tough, we still need to eat.

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,959
I figured the Demon God Emperor would send troops.

93
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,879
But I didn't expect he'd send two hundred fifty thousand.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,119
Lu Di.

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,559
You're worth quite a lot, huh.

96
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,839
Of course.

97
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,679
I am, after all...

98
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,679
This army of two hundred fifty thousand—

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,399
How do you plan to handle them?

100
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,599
The Telan Fortress.

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,599
And my fifty thousand troops.

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,199
I can help Your Highness make them surrender.

103
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,799
Then hold the fortress and defend.

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,839
Why do you think

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,999
they would surrender?

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,479
They've been my men for years.

107
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,999
I trust them.

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,719
Alright.

109
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,599
Ross is five days away from Telan Fortress.

110
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,879
You leave today.

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,719
You must take the fortress before Ross arrives.

112
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,879
Capture Telan Fortress.

113
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,439
Rest assured, Your Highness.

114
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,239
Lu Di.

115
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,079
Right now, we

116
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,079
are like grasshoppers tied to the same rope.

117
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,959
No, my lord.

118
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,079
This is too risky.

119
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,079
Bai Chuan.

120
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,439
All the way till now,

121
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,199
when have we not taken risks?

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,199
Besides,

123
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,199
we can only rely on the fifty thousand Demon Race troops in Telan Fortress.

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,039
Only then can we fight the Demon Race.

125
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,039
Otherwise,

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,319
all our efforts in the Far East

127
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,799
will be wasted.

128
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,239
I'll lead the Xiuzi Battalion ahead at full speed.

129
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,319
Arrive at Telan Fortress before Ross.

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,159
Meet up with Lu Di.

131
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,079
You two

132
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,319
hurry back to Koerni.

133
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,759
Bring the Feng Regiment and Huo Regiment.

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,759
Get there as soon as possible.

135
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,239
What if Lu Di suddenly betrays us?

136
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,159
If Lu Di deceives me,

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,079
I'll strangle him myself.

138
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,639
Why does that sound so much like a jealous wife?

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,199
Alright.

140
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,599
But, my lord,

141
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,319
please be careful.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,959
If things get out of hand,

143
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,679
don't force it.

144
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,039
You must come back alive.

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,999
To us,

146
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,199
you're worth more than a hundred Telan Fortresses.

147
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,439
Bai Chuan.

148
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,159
Since when did you care so much about me?

149
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,199
Since the day you borrowed a thousand silver coins.

150
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,520

151
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:30,999
(IMPERIAL CALENDAR YEAR 782, JUNE 21)
Brothers,

152
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:31,999
(IMPERIAL CALENDAR YEAR 782, JUNE 21)
Move faster!

153
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,479
(IMPERIAL CALENDAR YEAR 782, JUNE 21)
Within three days,

154
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,599
reach Telan Fortress.

155
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,039
- Yes.
- Yes.

156
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,439
What's going on?

157
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,799
The army's been assembled for half a day.

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,039
Why is there no sign of the supplies?

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,479
It's those jerks from Soth.

160
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,359
I've talked till my mouth is dry.

161
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,519
They just won't send the supplies.

162

(FAR EAST
TELAN FORTRESS)

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,159
My lord.

164
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,479
Lu Di isn't playing us, is he?

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,799
Why isn't he out yet?

166
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,079
He's coming out.

167
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,239
(LU DI)

168
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,399

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,759
(Will an ambush be waiting for us?)

171
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,679
(And a sudden falling gate?)

172
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,439
(If we don't enter...)

173
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,159
I'll say it again.

174
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,919
Today we must head to Telan Fortress at once.

175
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,999
Every minute you delay here

176
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,719
puts my lord in more danger.

177
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,679
Then I'll say it again too.

178
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,319
We won't accept the Demon Race's surrender.

179
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
And we won't help that damn Lu Di

180
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,599
defend Telan Fortress.

181
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,158
As for sending troops,

182
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,879
we don't agree.

183
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,439
This is the lord's order.

184
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,919
It's not for you to agree or not.

185
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,999
Alright.

186
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,639
What we say doesn't matter.

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,439
Someone else will decide.

188
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,119
Bran.

189
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,359
The elder said

190
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,599
the Demon Race is always cunning and cruel.

191
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,679
He asks the King of Light to think twice.

192
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,719
As for accepting the Demon Race's surrender,

193
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,079
the elder said

194
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,799
he still needs to consult God Audi.

195
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,759
My lord.

196
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,479
Are we entering the city or not?

197
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,260
M-m-my lord!

198
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,079
Look!

199
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,079
That must be Ross's Demon Race army.

200
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,839
Enter the city.

201
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,279
- Greetings, Your Highness King of Light.
- Greetings, Your Highness King of Light.

202
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,519
Lu Di.

203
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,119
You did well.

204
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,239
Rise.

205
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,740
Enter the city.

206
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,999
My lord.

207
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,559
Don't speak.

208
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,879
Mind your bearing.

209
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,500
Bran.

210
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,319
General Bai Chuan.

211
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,679
You don't need to say more.

212
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,119
We must obey the elder's orders.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,559
I just ask you—

214
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,359
If Telan Fortress falls,

215
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,679
and my lord dies,

216
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,079
do you think we

217
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,359
can stop the Demon Race invasion?

218
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,319
You lead the troops over.

219
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,999
I'll handle the supplies.

220
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,599
We've lost a whole day.

221
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,519
No idea how things are on my lord's side.

222
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,759
Set out overnight.

223
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,799
We should still make it in time.

224
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,400
(ROSS LEGION, OULEG LEGION, KING OF LIGHT LEGION
IMPERIAL CALENDAR YEAR 782, JUNE 26)

225
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,159
People in the city, listen up!

226
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,279
Lu Di has betrayed the nation and joined the enemy.

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,359
His crime is unforgivable.

228
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,879
You must execute him at once.

229
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,839
Open the gates and let the army in.

230
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,119
You may be spared.

231
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,919
Lu Di.

232
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,039
Letting him shout down there like this—

233
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,799
might someone really want to take your head for credit?

234
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,359
And your fifty thousand troops turning into five thousand—

235
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,959
we'll settle that with you later.

236
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,799
Archers!

237
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,879
Loose arrows!

238
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,399

Crossbows, hurry!

241
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,439
Archers, take your positions.

242
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,639
Where are the fire arrows?

243
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,639
Darn it.

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,679
What are you doing?

245
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,159
Fire!

(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

247
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,319
Sir.

248
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,839
Should we call reinforcements
from the North Gate?

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,239
I think Lu Di's side
can't hold much longer.

250
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,279
Don't worry.

251
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,959
With the battle at this stage,

252
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,879
Lu Di has even less way out
than we do.

253
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,439
Strange...

254
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,959
Why aren't the enemy at the North Gate
attacking yet?

255
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,479
Lord.

256
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,479
Still not attacking?

257
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,719
If we keep waiting,

258
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,639
Te Lan Fortress

259
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,199
will really fall to Ross.

260
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,959
(Demon Race, Second Corps, Oule)
Relax, Ross isn't that capable.

261
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,679
It'll take at least seven or eight days.

262
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,799
He can't take it that fast.

263
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,879
So...

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,279
What are we waiting for?

265
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,439
Do you really think His Majesty sent us

266
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,079
to help Ross?

267
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,559
No.

268
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,879
His Majesty doesn't want the Tarta Tribe
to win.

269
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,479
But he doesn't want them to lose either.

270
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,559
You get it now?

271
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,879
Retreat.

272
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,799
Pull back for now.

273
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,520
(Ross Corps, Oule Corps, King of Light Corps)

274
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:02,839
Sir.

275
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,519
The Third Division has retreated.

276
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,919
Darn Lu Di.

277
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,239
Useless at quelling rebellion,

278
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,959
but fights us

279
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,719
like his life depends on it.

280
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,119
How's Oule's side at the North Gate?

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,039
They haven't attacked yet.

282
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,199
What the heck is going on?

283
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,279
Pull back.

284
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,799
Rest for the night.

285
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,959
Attack again tomorrow.

286
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,919
What have we even done?

287
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,559
Lu Di's afraid His Majesty will blame him,

288
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,719
so he sided with the rebels.

289
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,239
Why should we follow him
and become traitors too?

290
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,319
I can't fight this war anymore.

291
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,239
Zhaocai.

292
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,039
Eat more.

293
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,759
Once we're on the battlefield,

294
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,799
don't embarrass the boss.

295
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:27,879
Remember.

296
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,159
Lu Di and the King of Light
must be captured alive.

297
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,439
Catch those two,

298
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,119
and His Majesty won't punish us.

299
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,199
Who knows,

300
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,679
he might even grant us a title.

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,559
Break in!

302
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,199
Kill!

303
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,559
Kill the traitors!

304

Brothers!

305
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,919
Follow me!

306
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,199
What's happening?

307
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,119
Sir.

308
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,279
Lu Di's men have rebelled.

309
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:50,959
What?

310
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,039
Rebelled?

311
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,559
Aren't these all your men?

312
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,399
How did you let this happen?

313
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,039
Your Highness.

314
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,159
Please don't be angry.

315
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,479
Careful not to hurt your hand.

316
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,039
How many are there?

317
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,399
Hard to say.

318
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,519
At least a few thousand.

319
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,839
But don't worry, sir.

320
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,679
We've already followed your orders

321
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,719
and stationed troops at the southeast gates.

322
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,559
If anyone tries anything,

323
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,679
our men will strike immediately.

324
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,359
Good.

325
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,719
You go keep watch too.

326
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,479
Yes, sir.

327
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,279
My Lord Lu Di,

328
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,359
those people outside—

329
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,879
what should we do?

330
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,799
Don't worry, Your Highness.

331
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,879
Leave it to me.

332
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,079
Capture Lu Di alive!

335
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,839
Not good!

336
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,599
It's an ambush!

337
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,559
Why did you rebel?

338
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,639
You're the rebel.

339
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,759
We're acting for His Majesty,

340
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,039
to eliminate traitors.

341
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,980
Wait.

342
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,239
Spare their lives.

343
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,599
Confiscate their weapons.

344
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,239
Send them to the POW camp.

345
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,159
Such a big show of force—

346
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,439
are they planning a final battle?

347
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,519
Any news from Bai Chuan?

348
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,879
No.

349
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,479
What are they doing?

350
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,159
Look over there!

351
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,559
Since when did the Demon Race
have such advanced siege weapons?

352
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,319
Quick, destroy them!

353
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,799
Don't let them near the walls!

354
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,519
Fire arrows!

355
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,239
And...

356
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,279
Catapults.

357
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,279
The catapults aren't ready yet.

358
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,159
No matter what,

359
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,439
just take them out!

360
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,999
- Yes!
- Yes!

361
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,799
We can't destroy these things
from a distance.

362
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,719
(Insufficient defensive equipment)

363
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,159
(The garrison is far from enough)

364
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,959
(If these new Demon Race siege towers reach the walls)

365
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,759
(Te Lan Fortress will fall)

366
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,838
(This is the Demon Race's gateway
to retake the Far East)

367
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,639
(We)

368
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,199
(can't hold it)

369
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,519
Let me show you the power
of my Well Tower Formation!

370
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,599
How about...

371
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,119
I send men outside the walls

372
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,679
to destroy those things?

373
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,399
Are you sure the men you send

374
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,199
won't just surrender to Ross
once they're out?

375
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,839
Duke.

376
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,039
Hold this place.

377
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,519
Those Jinglan Towers—

378
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,279
Governor Lu Di and I will go ourselves.

379
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,279
Sir.

380
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,119
It's not time for the commander
to fight in person yet.

381
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,399
Let me handle it.

382
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,519
Duke.

383
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,479
Don't worry, sir.

384
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,839
I won't let you down.

385
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,020
Hey!

386
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,799
Got any fire oil?

387
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,959
Get me plenty of it.

388
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:36,683
