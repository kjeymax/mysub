[PREVIOUSLY ]
We’re already here

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,159
Might as well go deeper while we can

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,279
And hunt for some rare treasures and immortal troves

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,119
Shut it, dead dog

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,559
Hurry up

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,559
A coffin hidden in this peerless death zone

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
Could it be the corpse of an ancient Great Emperor?

30

Ye Fan

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,279

Mom...

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,759
Just a wisp of aura from this place pulled me into an illusion

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,919
He said

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,159
This is a saint of the ancient human race

36
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,559
We must never let him out

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,959

Come find this place—now!

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,279
Or I’ll kill her

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,279
Remember

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,919
Come alone

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,159
Using Liu Yiyi as a hostage

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,879
And he knows how to use a phone

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,719
Could it be...

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,999
Someone who came to this world with me?

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,879
This place...

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,479
Lava hiding ice within

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,199
If I’m right

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,559
It’s in the Central Region of Eastern Wilderness—

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Fire Demon Ridge

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Like a dog

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,999
This Emperor will torment him to death

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,959
Still...

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,279
The spot my human pet’s beast pet found

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Is seriously ominous

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
This place

59
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,439
Once gave birth to a Fire Race Sacred Spirit

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,079
His power reached the heavens, rivaling ancient emperors

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,799
But rumor says

62
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,399
He was ultimately slain by the Ruthless Great Emperor

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,999
After his death

64
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,399
The terrain here began circulating source energy

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,639
Filled with layer upon layer of restrictions

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,479
Brother Ye

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
I’ll slaughter our way in with you

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,239
Yeah

69
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,319
If worse comes to worst

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,559
I’ll call Big Bandit and the bros

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,399
And drag Old Man Tu Tian along

72
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
We’ll all go together

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,599
It’s useless

74
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,039
They’ll definitely be prepared

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,039
Charging in like that

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,119
Is the same as telling them to kill the hostage

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Ye Fan

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,679

79
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,959
Do you really have to save her?

80

81

You’ll already be a Divine Bridge cultivator

83
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
We’ll definitely meet again

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,519
She came from the same place as me

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,559
I can’t let her die

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Fine

87
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,519
Since

88
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,679
You’ve decided to save her

89
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,759
Then this little immortal

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,799
Will reluctantly lend you a hand

91
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,879
I’m actually pretty curious

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,079
About people from your hometown

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,159
The one who kidnapped Liu Yiyi

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,639
Is obviously coming for me

95
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,159
And clearly weaker than I am

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,279
But this trap is deadly

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,319
No need to drag the others into danger

98
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,079
You’ve been tailing me the whole way

99

Knew you’d try to come alone, kid

101

If this Emperor didn’t keep an eye on you

102

Even Your Majesty came in person?

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,839

105

But after passing the Myriad Luo Gate

The phenomenon can’t be used for a short time
