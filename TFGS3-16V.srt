27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,759
Young man, we meet again.

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,039
Senior—

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
You...

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,079
No need to worry.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,959
I mean no harm.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,799
Lady Long, how fares your grandfather?

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,239
Decades since I last saw that rascal.

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,639
I am the ancestral forefather of Eastern Chu's emperor.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,039
Met your grandfather a few times.

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,199
This junior pays respects.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,479
You must already know a treasure will emerge in Pingyang City.

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,599
Remember the ancient tomb beneath the palace?

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Chennan,

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,959
we explored it together once.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,839
If a treasure truly appears, it must come from there.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,879
But when I tried to retrieve it, I found a new barrier sealing it.

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,599
Divine,

44

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,199
demon reborn

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,959
or true self reborn?

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,719
I tried forcing entry,

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,519
but there's always a higher sky.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,759
With just words, senior—

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
Back then I had a premonition my end might be near.

51
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,719
approaching.

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,279
So today, I come with a request.

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,199
When the treasure emerges,

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,879
I hope you'll wield Hou Yi's Bow and lend me aid

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,359
to prevent chaos destroying Eastern Chu's royal house.

56
00:03:59,677 --> 00:03:59,970
Hm

57
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,279
Fine words—

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,519
protecting the royals is fake,

59
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,999
extending life with the treasure is real.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,439
This junior's realm is lacking—

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,319
hard to contend with true giants.

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,839
Don't sell yourself short.

63
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,359
If that arrow tastes your blood,

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,439

65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,279
[Haha]

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,359
Senior flatters me.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,239
If you aid me fully,

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,999
afterward this divine bow is yours forever.

69
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Deal?

70
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,119
So the old fox took Hou Yi's Bow for this.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,479
All planned.

72
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,879
Tomorrow night, my men will escort you to the palace.

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,639
You won't miss it.

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,119
Finally gone.

75

174
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,359
Could it be the emerging treasure?

175
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,479
Last full moon, signs appeared.

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,239
If no surprises, if no surprises—

177
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,799
five days from now, another full moon—

178
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,959
the treasure will emerge.

179
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,359
It will shake the eight directions.

180
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,999
Countless experts will swarm here.

181
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,479
I’ll pass Hou Yi's Bow to you now,

182
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,319
just in case something happens when the treasure emerges.

183
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,679
Also, stop staying at the inn.

184
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,839
I’ve prepared our old spot for you.

185
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
[Hm]

186
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,119
Same old place,

187
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,359
but I’m no longer the man I once was.

188
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,079
Dream Fairy—

189
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,399
[Eastern Chu Kingdom — Imperial Royal Garden]
I’ve booked the entire Drunken Immortal Pavilion.

190
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,319
You must grace the banquet.
[Eastern Chu Kingdom — Imperial Royal Garden]

191
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,879
You must grace the banquet!

192
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:46,176
[Eastern Chu Kingdom — Imperial Royal Garden]

193
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,799
Scram!
[Eastern Chu Kingdom — Imperial Royal Garden]

194
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,759
The Dream Fairy should visit my chancellor’s mansion instead.
[Eastern Chu Kingdom — Imperial Royal Garden]

195
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,999
I’ll think about it.

196
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,279
Then, Your Highness the Eldest Princess—

197
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,319
farewell for now.

198
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,519
You’ve had a rough time, junior sister.

199
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Hou Yi's Bow...

200
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,559
So Chennan has already met the ancestor.

201
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,479
Dream Fairy,

202
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
what are you doing here?

203
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,599
Others can come, why can’t I?

204
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,079
Plum blossoms in the twelfth month—

205
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,439
anyone may admire them.

206
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,079
Heh.

207
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,119
Our spar that day

208
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
still fresh in my mind.

209
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,679
I’d love another round with the Dream Fairy.

210
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,839
Nonsense.

211
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Or do you really mean it?

212
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,559
Come on!

213
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,559
How do you have the Heaven-Piercing Halberd?

214
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,799
Took it from that little Hun Tian devil, of course.

215
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,999
I see.

216
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,239
You used me.

217
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
What are you saying?

218
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,439
Didn’t you run the moment you saw me?

219
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,759
So now you want to team up against him?

220
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,999
He’s tied to the Path of Annihilation—

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,559
our common enemy.

222
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,479
And the heir of Annihilation is about to appear.

223
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,959
With Eastern Chu in chaos over the treasure,

224
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,039
teaming up is our best move.

225
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,639
Righteous and demonic paths are mortal foes—

226
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,719
you have no reason to refuse.

227
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,159
But if you get the chance to kill me,

228
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,039
you won’t hesitate.

229
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,999
Then for half a year,

230
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,319
no fighting between us.

231
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,239
Deal?

232
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,519
Fine.

233
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,159
Beautiful Lady Longwu,

234
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,399
we meet again.

235
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,039
It’s you.

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,519
Lady Long—

237
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,599
still have the ice lotus I gave you?

238
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,879
This popsicle is delicious!

239
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,719
Hundred-flower fragrance, so refreshing.

240
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,399
Got another?

241
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,999
Gone.

242
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:46,919
[Aww]

243
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Don’t be sad, miss.

244
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
I promised—

245
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,799
next time we meet,

246
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,039
I’d give you a lotus that never wilts.

247
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,439
Thanks,

248
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
but no need.

249
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Lady Long—

250
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,559
Gorgeous!

251
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I love it.

252
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Chu Yu!

253
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,239
Sister Longwu—

254
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,959
don’t trust this huge pervert!

255
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,040
He gives gifts to every pretty girl he meets, but

256
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,560
they all get rejected.

257
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,639
My heart is sincere—

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,479
just often misunderstood.

259
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,799
Since Princess Yu has business with Lady Long,

260
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,519
I’ll take my leave.

261
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,439
Perhaps

262
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,159
we’ll meet again.

263
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,399
Little princes—

264
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,519
why are you back?

265
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Chennan!

266
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,239
I’m still a princess of Eastern Chu.

267
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,999
With everything happening in Pingyang,

268
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,679
of course I came back.

269
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,039
Didn’t the old monster take it back?

270
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,999
You thief—how’d you steal it again?

271
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,599
You walking disaster!

272
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,880
If you don't want to embarrass yourself, behave.

273
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:53,186
Hmp

274
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,119
Hun Tian Great Demon King—

275
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,359
you broke your word!

276
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:26,577
[Church of Light: The Church of Light is the most orthodox religion of the Western Continent, worshipping the God of Light. Among the people, it is believed that one who holds the power of light is blessed by the deity of light. Under the supreme teachings of the Church of Light, the church is divided into five major branches, each responsible for different duties. The Bright Hall is the highest authority of the Church and presides over all matters of doctrine. Its Church Knights—known as the Knights of Radiance—are a corps of paladins blessed with sacred light. Fully armored in divine gear, they are unstoppable in battle, believed to be able to purify any darkness. The Church of Light’s ritual system is strict and ancient. Its core doctrine is to use the power of light to suppress all evil and eliminate all darkness. Rumor has it that the Holy Son of Light, bearing the purest divine power, was born from within the radiance.]

[Next Episode Preview]
Just snatched the Heaven-Piercing Halberd from my disciple,

278
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,359
and here comes the master.

279
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,279
By order of my ancestral forefather:

280
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,279
anyone who forces entry into the palace

281
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
will be killed without mercy.

282
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,919
With this princess and Xiao Yu standing guard,

283
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,479
you won't set foot in the palace.

284
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Oh?

285
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,319
Big words.
