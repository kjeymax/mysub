00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,960
Sacrifice of Ten Thousand Dragons.

4

Go to battle!

5
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,560
Use this power

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,320
to trample the world beneath your feet!

7
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
I, Ao Xue,

8
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,290
in the name of the Dragon God,

9
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,520
Summon the Nine Heavens Golden Dragon.

10
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,350
The dragon

11
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,000
is the true ruler of the world.

Episode 1
[The Fall of the East Sea]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

38
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,250
(In the beginning of creation,)

39
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,410
(the Eternal Flame
lit up heaven and earth.)

40
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,280
(The first dragon in the world)

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,050
(was born from it.)

42
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,910
(He became the progenitor
of the Dragon Clan,)

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,290
(Naga.)

44
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,770
(The descendants of Naga)

45
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,810
(founded the Dragon Clan of the Four Seas
on the Central Continent.)

46
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,130
(Dragon Clan are born with)

47
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,930
(the power to command celestial forces.)

48
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,610
(This power is known
as the Soul of the Dragon.)

49
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,710
(The great dragon ancestors)

50
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,000
(relied on their mighty
Soul of the Dragon)

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
(to awe the Three Realms.)

52
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,290
(Nowadays...)

53
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,140
(East Sea Dragon Palace)

54
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,080
Elder Dragon King.

55
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,790
The war between the Gods
and the Asuras grows fiercer by the day.

56
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm afraid it will soon spread
to Dragon Clan.

57
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,965
(Manluo)
The one fighting the Asuras this time

58
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,337
(Manluo)
is the God of Light Soul.

59
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,110
(Ao Lei, South Sea Dragon King)
The Shadow Gods are not involved.

60
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,830
Their power is immense.

61
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,100
What are you trying to say?

62
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,040
Earlier, the Shadows mentioned

63
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,640
joining forces with us to create
the Celestial Dragon Realm.

64
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,890
Their sincerity is undeniable.

65
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,040
As long as we hand over
the Golden Soul of the Dragon,

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,830
we will share a golden era with them.

67
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,930
(Ao Guang, East Sea Dragon King)
Nonsense!

68
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,330
The Golden Soul of the Dragon
is the bloodline of our ancestors!

69
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,790
This matter is not up for discussion.

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,870
Guang.

71
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,530
Opposing the Shadows

72
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,170
will only bring annihilation
upon the Dragon Clan.

73
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,440
Silence!

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,670
If you dare side with the Shadows,

75
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,020
I will kill you myself!

76
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,600
Useless old fool.

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,032
(Ao Yilong)
Ao Yilong.

78
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:31,870
(Son of the South Sea Dragon King)
Die!

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,790
You…

80
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,040
How dare you…

81
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,290
Send the order.

82
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,870
Mobilize the entire army.

83
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,140
(Ao Jiao, East Sea Crown Prince)

84
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,170
Why does Father suddenly want to see me?

85
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,470
(Ao Ye, Son of the East Sea Dragon King)
He…

86
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,330
He's feeling unwell.

87
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,330
He said

88
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,750
he has something to entrust to you.

89
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,870
Where is Father?

90
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,860
He's...

91
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,060
He's just up ahead.

92
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,910
Release the arrows!

93
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,930
(East Sea Third Uncle)

94
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,910
Guang.

95
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,250
Darn it.

96
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,170
Kill him!

97
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,080
I am not here today to kill.

98
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,080
Those who surrender
to the Celestial Dragon Realm

99
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:01,790
will be spared.

100
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,500
How dare you killed your superior,
Elder Dragon King.

101
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,830
Prince Ao Jiao will never let you go!

102
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,040
Ao Jiao?

103
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,600
I've already arranged for father and son
to reunite in the underworld.

104
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
Wretched old thief of the South Sea!

105
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,040
You traitor.

106
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,770
It's Crown Prince Ao Jiao.

107
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,960
Ao Jiao.

108
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,330
Do you think I'm dead?

109
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,370
Your Highness.

110
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,420
Father.

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
South Sea.

112
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,460
You're looking for death!

113
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,960
Kill all these villains!

114
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,670
Avenge the Elder Dragon King!

115
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,060
Kill!

116
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,830
The Shadow Legion
should make their move.

117
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,870
Your Highness.

118
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,280
The Shadows forces are huge.

119
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,290
We're outnumbered.

120
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,850
We might as well retreat for now.

121
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,670
Gather the Dragon Clan forces
and then strike back.

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,710
Retreat!

123
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,620
Perhaps the Soul of the Dragon

124
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:44,040
that the Great God
of the Red Flame wants is on Ao Jiao.

125
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,120
Hurry!

126
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,120
Father.

127
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
From now on,

128
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,960
the lives of the Dragon Clan

129
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,670
will be decided by you.

130
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,000
Shut up!

131
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,580
The Shadows are our heaven.

132
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,920
We're just doing their work.

133
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,040
Uncle.

134
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,330
Both you and the Shadows are heaven.

135
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,710
Please spare

136
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,790
Ao Ye's life.

137
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,120
To show loyalty,

138
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:13,670
I…

139
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm willing to cut off my dragon horn!

140
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,250
Useless eyesore.

141
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,830
I'll kill you!

142
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,500
Wait.

143
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,330
He still has a use.

144
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,830
Send the good news
to the Shadow Gods first.

145
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,420
Yes!

146
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,040
Father.

147
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,580
Then this East Sea...

148
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,170
You handle it within three days.

149
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,350
Three days of city-wide slaughter!

150
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,550
Kill!

151
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,180
(North Sea Dragon Palace)

152
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,955
(Ao Bing, Princess of the North Sea)

153
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,060
(Ao Shun, North Sea Dragon King)

154
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,370
The newly appointed
East Sea Dragon King,

155
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,710
what wind blew you here?

156
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,350
South Sea colluding with the Shadows

157
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,080
and murdered my father.

158
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,210
The East Sea Dragon King is dead.

159
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,250
It's indeed regrettable

160
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,620
about the Elder Dragon King.

161
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,120
If you're not avenging him,

162
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,670
what brings you to North Sea?

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,490
I hope the North Sea will send troops

164
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
to join me in punishing the South Sea.

165
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,830
I cannot interfere

166
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,330
your internal matters.

167
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,790
Go back.

168
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,250
This concerns the survival
of the Dragon Clan,

169
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,490
not just the grudges
between the South Sea and East Sea.

170
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,750
If we don't resist,
our entire clan will perish.

171
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,760
The flames of war

172
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,670
will soon spread to the North Sea.

173
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,790
Such a hassle.

174
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,920
You go back first.

175
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,830
Let me think it over.

176
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,500
Darn it.

177
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,870
The guy from the North Sea
keeps shirking.

178
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,710
The North Sea Dragon Clan
lives apart from the world.

179
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,740
Even when the Dragon Clan
faces foreign invasions,

180
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,460
they prefer to stay isolated,

181
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,500
and avoid conflict.

182
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,420
So spineless!

183
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,040
Shut up!

184
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,170
Don't slander the North Sea like that!

185
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,120
She is...

186
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,710
The Princess of the North Sea!

187
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,530
Your Highness.

188
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,290
What I just said was out of line.

189
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,660
If it offended you,

190
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,290
please forgive me.

191
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,710
The North Sea has no cowards.

192
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,000
We just don't fight unwinnable battles.

193
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,080
I want to see

194
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,120
if you're worth following.

195
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,570
Ice Soul of the Dragon.

196
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,490
Oh no!

197
00:13:45,514 --> 00:14:03,214
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

198
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,960
Forgive my offense.

199
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,780
Your Highness possesses
Soul of the Dragon,

200
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,200
if you can come with me...

201
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:12,960
I will follow you.

202
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,460
See, learn from this.

203
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,960
Please.

204
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,330
Ao Jiao.

205
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,890
Long time no see.

206
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,171
(Manasa, North Sea Queen Mother)
Now you bear

207
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:45,210
(Manasa, North Sea Queen Mother)
the future of the entire Dragon Clan.

208
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,100
(Flaming Shadow Palace)

209
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,500
Great God of the Red Flame.

210
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,560
(Tianyong Star, the Shadows)
The East Sea Dragon Clan has been taken.

211
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
These are high-quality
Soul of the Dragon offered to you.

212
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,000
(Nezha, Great God of the Red Flame)
High-quality?

213
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,870
And the legendary Golden Dragon Soul?

214
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,860
No news yet?

215
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,500
Great God!

216
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,470
Great God!

217
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,250
Spare my life!

218
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,710
I will speed up the search!

219
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,830
Useless!

220
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,550
Go back and search again.

221
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,570
Present it to me as soon as possible.

222
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,920
Otherwise,

223
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,080
your fate will be miserable.

224
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,960
Yes.

225
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,870
At once!

226
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,790
(Darn it.)

227
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,170
(This won't last long.)

228
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,580
(Qing.)

229
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,790
(Dragon Clan Elder, West Sea)
Dragon Lady, Ao Qing

230
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,330
had an affair with
the Dragon Clan's enemy, Nezha.

231
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,420
Now she dies to atone for her sins.

232
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,790
You forced her to death.

233
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,830
This hatred is endless!

234
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,960
Shame on being the celestial.

235
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,120
Join the Shadows.

236
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,100
Go take revenge.

237
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,920
The stupid rules.

238
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,540
I want the entire Dragon Clan
to be buried with Qing.

239
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,500
Take him down.

240
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,670
Go!

241
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,330
Nezha.

242
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,513
(Primordial Jade Lord)
Use the power I granted

243
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:38,750
(Primordial Jade Lord)
to enslave the Dragon Clan.

244
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,460
Find the bloodline
of the Golden Dragon Soul.

245
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,830
Then you can resurrect your beloved.

246
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,420
From today onwards,

247
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,110
there is no Nezha in this world.

248
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,690
Only the Red Flame.

249
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,500
(I will definitely find
the Golden Dragon Soul)

250
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,420
(and let you be reborn.)
