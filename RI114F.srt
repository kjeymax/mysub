(Balance is hard to break)

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,190
(Better to break it with external force)

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
Stop.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,910
Everyone, stand down.

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,500
If they act this way,

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,270
we should teach them a harsh lesson.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,910

(No need to rush)

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,790
You must also

39
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,170
defy your superiors.

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,870
Those who defy their superiors

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,270
do not deserve to live.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,550
I was reckless.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,390
Please forgive me, Wang Tongling.

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,220
To oppose me,

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,670
you are not qualified.

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,500
(If someone skilled in barriers could help me,)

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,630
(success would be certain.)

Episode 114
(Breaking the Barrier)
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,860
(Wang)

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,950
(The thousand-armored demon crystals within me)

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,670
(Thousand-armored demon crystals)
(If fully fused into immortal power)

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,430
(and combined with all my Immortal Jade)

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,630
(it’s barely enough to reach Late Soul Transformation)

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,910
Halt, stranger.

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,710
I have urgent business with Wang Tongling.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,150
The elder is in seclusion.

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,390
Please leave.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,110
Fellow Daoist Yao barged in rudely.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,510
Is this not improper?

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,150
I was presumptuous in this matter.

61
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,790
Fellow Daoist Wang, please don’t take offense.

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,390
But I truly have an urgent request.

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,210
If it were not urgent,

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,110
do not blame me for being rude.

65
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,030
Fellow Daoist Wang,

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,110
this matter is highly confidential.

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,030
I must take precautions.

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,390
Please don’t mind.

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,710
This land of demon spirits

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,910
was once home to an Immortal Manor.

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,110
After the immortal realm collapsed,

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,510
it fell silent.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,950
I chanced upon the site of an old Immortal Manor.

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,790
But I cannot break the barrier outside alone.

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,830
I heard Fellow Daoist Wang is skilled in barrier arts.

76
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,790
If we succeed in entering,

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,230
we split the immortal treasures half and half.

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,590
What do you say?

79
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,230
(The Immortal Manor is worth exploring)

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,550
(but this person is not trustworthy.)

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,430
(I must investigate further.)

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,110
I am at a critical point in my cultivation.

83
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,910
I cannot help.

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
Forgive me.

85
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,230
I suppose Fellow Daoist Wang is striving for Late Soul Transformation.

86
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,750
But Immortal Jade is scarce here.

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,350
To show my sincerity,

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,990
I am willing to offer you

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,910
all the Immortal Jade needed for Early Ascension.

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,710
This is a deposit.

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,390
Enough to help you reach Late Soul Transformation.

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,910
Help me enter the Immortal Manor,

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,910
and the rest

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,350
will be given to you after success.

95
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,350
(No wonder she’s the Blood Ancestor’s daughter)

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,190
(such a generous offer.)

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,350
This matter is unpredictable.

98
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,350
Forgive me, I do not wish to take the risk.

99
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,350
If you worry for your safety,

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,390
you may take this Blood-Soul Elixir.

101
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,190
It will keep you safe.

102
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,910
(Blood-Soul Elixir)

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,230
(A treasure refined by Blood Ancestor’s secret arts)

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,390
(Even if the body is destroyed, they say)

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,550
(and the soul is annihilated,)

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,350
(this elixir can restore you anew.)

107
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,990
(Completely unharmed.)

108
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,710
(With this life-saving treasure,)

109
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,790
(death holds no fear.)

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,430
Blood Star’s supreme treasure.

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,790
I’ve heard of it.

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,510
How is it used?

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,590
This is my blood clan’s secret art.

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,350
I cannot reveal it easily.

115
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,990
Unless you agree to go with me.

116
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,430
I can give you one more

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,910
as payment.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,040
Agreed.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,150
Follow the instructions inside.

120
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,230
Leave a mark within the Blood-Soul Elixir.

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,190
Later, your soul and body will be linked.

122
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,790
You’ll be restored at my clan’s nearest formation.

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,870
In three days.

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,430
At the third quarter of the Purple Demon’s rise.

125
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,550
Meet at Drum Mountain.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,310
(Holding this item,)

127
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,310
(I feel my blood merging with it.)

128
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,500
(Three days later)

129
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,220
(Wang)

130
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,430
I’m heading out for a while.

131
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,800
While I’m gone,

132
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,150
you two stay in the Black Armor Battalion and wait for me.

133
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
Focus on your cultivation.

134
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
Yes.

135
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,860
(Drum Mountain, Land of Demon Spirits)

136
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,190
(I’ve given him enough Immortal Jade)

137
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,990
(Three days have passed)

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,230
(and he still hasn’t reached Late Soul Transformation.)

139
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,990
(It seems he’s nothing special.)

140
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,310
When the Purple Demon shines brightest,

141
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,630
blood light will appear on the compass.

142
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,310
Stay close.

143
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
(Outside Qinglin Immortal Abode, Land of Demon Spirits)

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,070
Sit in meditation.

145
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,550
Comprehend your own domain.

146
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,790
Once the Golden Rune accepts you,

147
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,110
you may walk the Path of the Honored Beast.

148
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,590
(Golden Rune merges into the body)

149
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,710
It's your turn.

150
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,510
(On Yao Xixue's body)

151
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,910
(There is a trace of Immortal Lord's aura)

152
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,950
(I only gained three strokes of the Golden Rune)

153
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,510
(He actually obtained six strokes)

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,150
(Could his domain surpass mine?)

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,030
(How is that possible?)

156
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,990
Let's go.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,990
(Yao Xixue is very familiar with this place)

158
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,430
(It's clearly not her first time here)

159
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,910
(As the Blood Ancestor's beloved daughter)

160
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,030
(She has all the Immortal treasures she needs)

161
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,150
(Why would she risk coming here?)

162
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,120
(Path of the Honored Beast, First Platform)

163
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,750
(She is fixated on this Immortal Manor)

164
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,830
(She must be acting on the Blood Ancestor's orders)

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,310
(Her goal is much greater)

166
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,750
There are twelve layers of seals here.

167
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,630
You and I will take turns breaking them.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,110
I'll handle the first layer.

169
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,800
Seal.

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,590
(This statue's cultivation rivals a Nascent Soul cultivator)

171
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,150
(Yao Xixue can seal it so easily)

172
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,310
(The Blood Star artifact truly lives up to its name)

173
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360
(That's...)

174
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
(Golden Rune)

175
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,990
(The Golden Rune inside the statue)

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,710
(is almost identical to the one gained from comprehending the domain)

177
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,350
(Could it be that this Golden Rune infused with Immortal power)

178
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,310
(is sealed inside the statue?)

179
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,760
(If that's true)

180
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,790
(these twelve seals may not be obstacles)

181
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,750
(but incredible opportunities)

182
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,020
(Path of the Honored Beast, Second Platform)

183
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,430
(It really is a Barrier construct)

184
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,390
(There must be a way to break the Barrier)

185
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,750
(With his mastery of Barriers, he could break the formation directly)

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,950
(Why is he still struggling with the statue?)

187
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,160
(As expected)

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,550
(This is the formation's core)

189
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,660
Release.

190
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,030
(Why is there a Golden Rune inside the statue?)

191
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,510
(This Golden Rune)

192
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,630
(seems to be layered atop the rune from the first platform)

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,590
(A lucky coincidence)

194
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,230
(Just good luck)

195
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,180
(Path of the Honored Beast, Third Platform)
(Just smashing the statue)

196
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,310
(What's so hard about that?)

197
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,550
(This time it's three strokes of the Golden Rune)

198
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,590
Where did it go wrong?

199
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,510
Why can't I produce the Golden Rune?

200
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,540
(Path of the Honored Beast, Fourth Platform)

201
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,710
(Four strokes of the Golden Rune)

202
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,480
(Indeed)

203
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,980
(Path of the Honored Beast, Fifth Platform)

204
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,790
What did he actually do?

205
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,900
(Path of the Honored Beast, Sixth Platform)

206
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,260
(Path of the Honored Beast, Seventh Platform)

207
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,540
(Path of the Honored Beast, Eighth Platform)

208
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:22,980
(Path of the Honored Beast, Ninth Platform)

209
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,380
(Path of the Honored Beast, Tenth Platform)

210
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,980
(Path of the Honored Beast, Eleventh Platform)

211
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,950
The last one.

212
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,430
Twelve strokes of the Golden Rune.

213
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
This is...

214
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,320
(Qing Lin)

215
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,230
The character "Lin"

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,430
I am Qing Lin.

217
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,950
(The former master of this Immortal Manor must be Qing Lin)

218
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,300
(Qing Lin)

219
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
(Something's off)

220
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,110
(These twelve layers of Immortal Restriction)

221
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,190
(get harder with each layer)

222
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,550
(but with Yao Xixue's abilities)

223
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,110
(she could easily pass through alone using her artifact)

224
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,750
(Why insist on bringing me along?)

225
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,230
(The Barrier statues aren't the final trial)

226
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
(Here)

227
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,510
(there's another danger)

228
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:35,834
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

229
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,510
(The fierce wind blocks the path)

230
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,750
(There's no way back now)

231
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,110
Take three sword strikes from me.

232
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,310
Only then are you qualified to enter the Immortal Manor.

233
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,630
Each of us will take one strike

234
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,590
and the last strike together.

235
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,240
Alright.

236
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,210
First person.

237
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,600
Step forward.

238
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,760
Fellow Daoist Wang

239
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,240
Please.

240
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,790
What if I refuse?

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,230
You've seen it yourself

242
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,750
The way back is sealed.

243
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,110
Anyone who receives the Golden Rune mark here

244
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,030
has only one way to survive—enter the Immortal Manor.

245
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,440
So

246
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,310
inviting me to break the Barrier was just a ruse

247
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,310
you really want me to block the sword for you.

248
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,830
We just need to withstand these three Ascendant sword strikes together

249
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,390
then we can enter the Immortal Manor.

250
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,950
Fellow Daoist Yao, you flatter me.

251
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,750
I am only at the mid-stage of Nascent Soul Transformation

252
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,790
How could I withstand the Ascendant sword strike?

253
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,310
Wang Lin

254
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,510
Break through with me

255
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,230
It's your only chance to survive.

256
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,830
Succeed and you live

257
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,470
fail and you die.

258
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,600
You

259
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,110
have no choice.

260
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,910
Don't worry.

261
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,150
Didn't you already take the Blood-Soul Elixir?

262
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,110
Fellow Daoist Yao, you're quite calculating.

263
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,510
Likewise.

264
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,310
I hope this time

265
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,310
you keep your word.

266
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,070
With your mid-stage Nascent Soul Transformation

267
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,870
taking one sword strike

268
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,350
won't necessarily kill you.

269
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,910
Quick, use the Blood-Soul secret art

270
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,590
to save your life, Fellow Daoist Wang.

271
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,190
But if you took the fake elixir I gave you

272
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,710
you'll surely die.

273
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,310
This Immortal Manor's location

274
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,150
is a top secret of my Blood Clan.

275
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,030
How could I let you leave alive?

276
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,950
Wang Lin

277
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,510
To sacrifice your life for my clan's cause

278
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,710
is your honor.

279
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,350
The first strike

280
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,110
you've passed.

281
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,950
The second strike

282
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,010
Are you ready?

283
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,080
Come.

284
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,950
I've entered this place several times

285
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,110
The Barrier statues

286
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,590
can all be overcome with artifacts

287
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,430
but these three sword strikes

288
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,790
I can only withstand two, no matter what.

289
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,430
Now that Wang Lin blocked one for me

290
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,430
there's no suspense in this battle.

291
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,350
The final strike.

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
Father

293
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,110
I did not let you down.

294
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,710
I made it.

295
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,390
Blood Clan

296
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,950
Hope for ascension

297
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,350
Thank you, Fellow Daoist Yao.

298
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,830
For helping me withstand two strikes.

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,150
You're still alive.

300
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,670
I suspected it long ago.

301
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,110
The Blood-Soul Elixir you gave me was fake.

302
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,430
Such a precious item—

303
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,830
How could you give it to me so easily?

304
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,710
And you were so concerned for my safety.

305
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,750
You probed me with your divine sense

306
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,230
to make sure I took the elixir.

307
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,590
If the elixir was fake,

308
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,110
then the Immortal Manor is likely real.

309
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,790
So I didn't use your Immortal Jade to reach Late Soul Transformation.

310
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,110
Instead, I turned it into Immortal Crystal and stored it within.

311
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,150
To use it for survival.

312
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,630
So you used Immortal Crystal to withstand the Ascendant sword aura.

313
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,150
You feigned falling into the abyss with the sword's force.

314
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,790
Waited for me to take two strikes,

315
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,990
and be gravely wounded.

316
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,990
Then you reaped the benefits.

317
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,830
Zhou Wutai once told me

318
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,030
the true use of the Liming Hat is to hide one's aura.

319
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,510
Don't waste your strength.

320
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,030
I've sealed your meridians.

321
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,710
Right now,

322
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,230
you can't use any immortal power.

323
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,070
Wang Lin

324
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,990
You may as well kill me.

325
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,880
To kill you—

326
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,350
You must have taken the Blood-Soul Elixir.

327
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,110
Killing you just sends you back to some blood array.

328
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,110
I will bind you with the Domain of Life and Death.

329
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,590
I won't kill you.

330
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,790
Then the Blood-Soul Elixir loses its purpose.

331
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,880
You—

332
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,310
(She schemed tirelessly)

333
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,710
(using Ascendant sword aura and a fake Blood-Soul Elixir in tandem)

334
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,150
(to set a deadly trap for me.)

335
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,790
(What immortal treasures lie within this manor?)

336
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,590
(That the Blood Clan would go to such lengths?)

337
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,190
Remnant soul of the Immortal Manor

338
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,710
Welcomes its master.

339
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,510
This is the Immortal Manor token.

340
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,910
With it, you may freely enter and leave the manor.

341
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,710
Master

342
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,750
Please enter the manor.

343
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,940
(Qing Lin)

344
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,190
(This token is nearly identical to the one from the tides that day.)

345
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,710
(Almost no difference.)

346
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,860
(Token)

347
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,950
(Master of the Immortal Manor)

348
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,380
(No wonder.)

349
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,260
(Qinglin Immortal Abode, Land of the Demon Spirits)

350
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,230
(Just like a palace of the Immortal Realm.)

351
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,190
(Entirely crafted from Immortal Jade.)

352
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,110
(The barriers here are complete.)

353
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,430
(Standing apart.)

354
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,390
(Must be the legendary Immortal Restriction.)

355
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,230
(With my current power,)

356
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,990
(I can't shake it at all.)

357
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,310
(It seems the previous master once broke through here.)

358
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,030
(This technique—)

359
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,230
(Could it be the ancient Plum Blossom Eighteen Restriction?)

360
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,070
(I used a predecessor's chance to obtain this wine vessel.)

361
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,110
(Though only ten drops remain,)

362
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,310
(it is immortal wine,)

363
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,310
(not a common thing.)

364
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,190
(The immortal brew is mellow.)

365
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,510
(It can intoxicate the soul.)

366
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,910
(I never expected)

367
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,830
(that this one drink)

368
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,710
would last a whole year.

369
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
(Renegade Immortal: Slaying to save his disciple, shaking the demon camp)
If I don't save Thirteen today—

370
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,110
All I, Wang Lin, have ever sought

371
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,150
will become nothing but a dream.

372
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,240
Thirteen!

373
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,760
Where are you?

374
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,510
Take this move: Hundred Waves of the Demon Sea!

375
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,510
Only then are you worthy to speak before me.

376
