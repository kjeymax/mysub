1
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,699
At this pace...

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,032
we won't reach the outpost
before nightfall.

3
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,233
Yeah...

4
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,132
Why not try the talisman art
Brother taught me?

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,566
Heavy to Light as Feather...

6
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:39,933
Activate!

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,032
Bro, leave the carriage to me.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,299
Cultivate in peace.

9
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:56,766
After Luofeng City,
my phase force surged.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,566
Time to evolve
the Twelve Spirit Palaces.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,299
If your Twelve Spirit Palaces
can handle that black mist...

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,432
I'll call you Grandpa!

13
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,433
I'll call you Grandpa!

14
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,132
Spirit converges in qi sea...

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,999
force shatters divine court.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,999
Nine apertures open,
sun and moon eternal!

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Heaven follows constant laws...

18
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:25,867
sun and moon alternate...

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,700
yin and yang in harmony...

20
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,067
inner cosmos born.

21
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,466
Body and spirit unite...

22
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,566
grand cycle complete.

23
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,466
Twelve Spirit Palaces manifest!

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,332
Old Ding's got some skills!

25
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,932
How do I truly summon
your true spirit form?

26
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,799
Told you already...

27
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,499
reach Spirit Emperor realm...

28
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,232
and I'll come out naturally.

29
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:29,699
If you don't...

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,966
how do I reach it?

31
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,032
And Ling'er's matter...

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
can't wait forever.

33
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:36,499
Whoa!

34
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Slow down!

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
You little rascal...

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,666
learn tricks from monkeys?

37
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,433
Bro...

38
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,632
I just don't want you tired.

39
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,332
Ungrateful!

40
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:58,633
Hmph.

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,566
Got it...

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
just teasing.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,732
Regret coming to the Great Wilderness
with me?

44
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,466
Anywhere with Bro is fine.

45
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:11,933
This Great Wilderness...

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,632
differs from elsewhere.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,099
Vicious criminals exiled here...

48
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,299
fierce malign spirits roam...

49
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,832
they love feasting
on girls like you.

50
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,099
I'm so scared~

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,332
Drama queen!

52
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:30,966
Once in the Wilderness...

53
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,499
we'll find that grand array...

54
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,766
cure your anomalous phase.

55
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:39,467
When I'm healed...

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,932
I'll become a phase master too.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,099
Then...

58
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,499
I'll protect you.

59
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,233
Giddyup!

60
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,199
Whoa!

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,066
This gate is like the Gates of Hell...

62
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,232
separating life and death.

63
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,466
Why isn't the gate opening?

64
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,032
Probably timed...

65
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,166
opens every few hours.

66
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:31,866
Enter alive, return dead!

67
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:33,966
Doomed fools, shut up!

68
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,833
Giddyup!

69
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:52,632
Bro...

70
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,232
No signs of life all the way...

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,566
we need to hurry...

72
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,166
reach the Spirit Suppression outpost...

73
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,367
rest up.

74
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,799
Bai Xi...

75
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:21,699
Nails...

76
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,966
This three-star malign king
is coming for you!

77
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,766
Perfect, I'm starving!

78
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Giddyup!

79
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,032
Malign spirits everywhere here...

80
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,467
show up uninvited.

81
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Bro, what's wrong?

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:33,932
Malign spirit incoming!

83
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,732
We've slain king-level before...

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,699
no need to panic.

85
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
You know nothing!

86
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,666
Wilderness maligns kill each other...

87
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,666
far stronger than peers.

88
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:44,933
Too late!

89
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:52,832
Stay inside!

90
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,233
I'll handle it.

91
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,866
Bro, I can help!

92
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:56,432
No!

93
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,066
Summoning your phase
worsens your condition.

94
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,833
Don't use it again!

95
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,567
Xiang...

96
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,866
Flying Flower Sword Shadows!

97
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,333
Break!

98
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:27,867
Golden Light Shield!

99
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,033
Defend!

100
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,033
Swift as Lightning!

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Dodge!

102
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,432
Blazing Soul Flames!

103
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:44,767
Burn!

104
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Phase Manifestation!

105
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:51,767
Scorching Breath!

106
00:06:51,791 --> 00:07:20,291
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

107
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:21,967
This...

108
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:23,967
mist...

109
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,833
Bro!

110
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,866
Give my brother back!

111
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,966
Get lost!

112
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,266
You brat...

113
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,466
I could tear this mongrel apart
with ease.

114
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,132
Hand over your body now!

115
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,266
Stop hesitating!

116
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:24,499
Never!

117
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:29,166
How will trash like you
avenge your brother?

118
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,332
Give me the body!

119
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:33,933
Shut up!

120
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,666
Ling'er, wake up!

121
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,566
Don't let it sway you!

122
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Bro...

123
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Ling'er...

124
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Ling'er!

125
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Bro...

126
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I knew...

127
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,999
you wouldn't abandon me.

128
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Ling'er...

129
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,466
No more using your phase!

130
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
If you lose control...

131
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,732
it'll possess you forever.

132
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Promise me!

133
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,966
This mist is strange...

134
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,532
Bro will get you out.

135
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,299
This mist...

136
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,999
feeds malign qi to spirits.

137
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,399
Bro, something's coming!

138
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Careful!

139
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,632
What are you waiting for?

140
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,366
Run!

141
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:17,766
Run!

142
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,166
This one's too tough for me!

143
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:22,867
Go!

144
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,333
People coming!

145
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
Follow me!

146
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,499
Seal Spirits, Halt Malign!

147
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Bind!

148
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Done.

149
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,632
Just wait for the malign mist
to disperse.

150
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,499
That was malign mist?

151
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,732
It coexists with the Great Wilderness...

152
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,799
origins unknown.

153
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,399
All malign spirits in it...

154
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,899
grow frenzied.

155
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,299
Especially that giant in the mist...

156
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,299
once it locks on...

157
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,999
nine deaths, one life.

158
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,666
Thanks for the aid, miss.

159
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,999
Your name?

160
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Ding Xiao...

161
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,666
Ninth-rank protector
at Nanlin Town Spirit Bureau...

162
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:21,166
exiled here for breaking rules.

163
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,966
My sister, Ding Ling...

164
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,699
bears a malign phase...

165
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,099
anomalies since childhood.

166
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,432
Who are you?

167
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,932
How...

168
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,066
don't recognize your big sister
we grew up with?

169
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:41,433
Sister Feng!

170
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Sister Yuanyuan!

171
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Sister Yuanyuan!

172
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,932
Gone so many years...

173
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,732
thought I'd never see you again.

174
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,232
How could that be?

175
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,266
In the Wilderness these years...

176
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,566
I longed to return to Nanlin
and find you.

177
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,599
But malign mist surged...

178
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,733
spirits everywhere.

179
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,299
Master insisted on Spirit Martial breakthrough
before letting me go.

180
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,332
Sister Yuanyuan...

181
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,899
how did you find us?

182
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,999
Long story...

183
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,133
Two months ago...

184
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,466
I broke through to Spirit Martial.

185
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,299
Master finally allowed return
to Nanlin.

186
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:16,932
But who knew...

187
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,932
upon arriving...

188
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,999
spirits besieged the city.

189
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,166
After it ended...

190
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,866
Commander Ling told me...

191
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:26,766
you'd been sent here.

192
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,166
I rushed back at once.

193
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,767
Years apart...

194
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,499
yet we meet here.

195
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,399
That lantern festival incident...

196
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,066
Commander Ling told me too.

197
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,832
If I hadn't left then...

198
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,399
that phase wouldn't have...

199
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,232
harmed you like this.

200
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:49,633
These years...

201
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,166
must've been hard for you.

202
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,632
Sister Yuanyuan...

203
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,399
This has weighed

204
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,499
on my heart all these years.

205
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:58,767
Sister Feng...

206
00:13:58,933 --> 00:13:59,933
don't blame yourself.

207
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,699
Ling'er and I are fine.

208
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,166
We came to the Great Wilderness...

209
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,332
to find the array
that purifies her anomalous phase.

210
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,266
But the Wilderness is vast...

211
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,599
no leads yet.

212
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,966
Such an array exists here?

213
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Could it be...

214
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,932
You know something?

215
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Rest assured...

216
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,199
with Haoxuan Sect's strength
in the Wilderness...

217
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,999
we'll find clues for you.

218
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:08,102
[Great Wilderness: The Great Wilderness lies far to the west of the Great Desolate region. It is a land of death and desolation. From ancient times to the present, countless powerful figures have fallen here—its soil soaked with blood, its air thick with resentment, like a vast burial ground of gods and heroes. The Great Wilderness is home to numerous fierce beasts and savage tribes. Ferocious creatures roam freely, and danger lurks at every step. For cultivators, this place is both a forbidden land and a crucible. Those who survive its trials often gain extraordinary strength, while the unprepared vanish without a trace.Over countless years, the Great Wilderness has been transformed by endless slaughter and struggle. Its violent aura grows ever stronger, its environment more hostile, resembling a flowing river of killing intent. Legends say that only those with supreme resolve and exceptional fortune can emerge alive—and those who do are forever changed by the experience. For this reason, the Great Wilderness is both feared and revered: a realm of chaos, death, and opportunity, where the weak are devoured and the strong are forged.]
