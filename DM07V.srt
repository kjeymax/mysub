I've never heard you mention your father.

My father...

22
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,410
Ever since my mother disappeared,

23
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,910
he's been trying to control me.

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,410
He forbade me from cultivation

I went to the capital.

29
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,110
happened in Luofeng City back then?

176
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,410
we came across an evil spirit born from Ms. Duanmu's soul.

177
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,610
What?!

178
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,910
Where is she now?

179
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,840
We've purified her soul.

180
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,810
She was imprisoned in the Spirit Suppression Tower for over a decade.

181
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,810
How cruel fate is!

182
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,310
Even after death, she suffered such torment.

183
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,010
It's all fated.

184
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,310
Besides, Mother never resented you.

185
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,410
Still,

186
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,910
would you please tell us more

187
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,210
about Luofeng City?

188
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,410
I only

189
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,710
heard about it from my master.

190
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,710
That day,

191
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,410
we were supposed to repel the evil power surrounding the 49 pairs of infants.

192
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,110
We didn't expect the formation to turn against us.

193
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,410
Only one pair of infants survived.

194
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,510
Our master was very kind.

195
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,810
He decided to adopt the babies.

196
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,010
May I ask your master's name?

197
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,410
Well,

198
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,110
his name is Ding Yuan.

199
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,210
Ding Yuan?

200
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,410
Grandpa?!

201
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,910
After adopting you and your sister,

202
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,810
he started investigating this accident in secret,

203
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,810
but his efforts were in vain.

204
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,610
Mr. Xue,

205
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,010
check this out.

206
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,110
This talisman...

207
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,310
seems to be the work of Xiao Yu, the lord of Luofeng City.

208
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,310
He was brought to justice years ago.

209
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,810
Where did you get this?

210
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,110
We've met many evil spirits so far.

211
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,610
This kind of talismans was found at every scene.

212
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,510
Besides,

213
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,010
my sister got tainted by evil power.

214
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,610
It has something to do with this talisman.

215
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,710
With my power severely impaired,

216
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,710
there is nothing I can do.

217
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,510
Is there really no other way?

218
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,610
Not exactly.

219
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,440
Master once told me...

220
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:39,564
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

221
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,610
Mr. Xue!

222
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,010
Finally, I can see Duanmu again.

223
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,510
Take care of him.

224
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,410
The Great Wasteland...

225
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,910
There is

226
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,440
a purification formation

227
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,910
there...

228
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,310
Mr. Xue.

229
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,010
You may rest in peace.

230
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,510
The living are but travelers,

231
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,010
going to the same destination.

232
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,910
Heaven or hell,

233
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,910
we're all pathetic.

234
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,440
Soul-burning Icicle! Scorch!

235
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,380
Invisible Blade! Pierce!

236
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,710
Ding Xiao.

237
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,710
My master ordered me to bring you back.

238
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,010
I don't care who you are.

239
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,110
None of you is getting out of here alive today.

240
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,610
Spirit Shield! Block!

241
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,510
Shadowless Blade! Slash!

242
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,910
Heavenly Thunder! Strike!

243
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,010
Spirit Shield! Block!

244
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,110
Sky-sundering Axe!

245
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,510
Golden Armor!

246
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,210
Your moves tell me you're from the Lingbu Division.

247
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,410
Tell me.

248
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,910
Who sent you here?

249
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,740
Ding Xiao.

250
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,410
Our sect won't let this go.

251
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,410
Three puppet talismans wasted.

252

[The Next Day]

253
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,710
Ling! [The Next Day]

254
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,730
[The Next Day]

255
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,130
I'm back. [The Next Day]

256
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,610
I'm back.

257
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,210
That evil power again.

258
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,740
Yeah.

259
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,910
The same scent.

260
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,310
Smells so good.

261
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,210
Ding Xiao.

262
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,810
Look!

263
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,810
This talisman again.

264
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,840
Ling must be kidnapped by someone.

265
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,040
Where could she be?

266
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,610
Let me use the Fire Bird to track Ling's whereabouts.

267
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,440
All disciples, listen up!

268
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,540
This is rather urgent.

269
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,910
Come back to the Sect immediately.

270
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:18,910
Recently,

271
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,980
a plague has broken out around Baihe.

272
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,710
The evil spirits are running wild.

273
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,510
Our branch in Baihe suffered heavy casualties.

274
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,810
They need reinforcements badly.

275
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,810
The Sect exists to protect the people from the evil spirits.

276
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,210
Every disciple of the Guibu Division

277
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,210
is responsible for eliminating them.

278
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,110
I've located Ling's whereabouts.

279
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,510
She's in

280
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,210
Baihe.

281
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,040
What?!

282
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,610
Those willing to take this mission

283
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,510
may light your life lamp.

284
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,240
I, Ling Jiang,

285
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,910
as the head of the Guibu Division,

286
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,310
will lead the charge.

287
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,010
Li Zhennan, level-8 Coffin Guard of the Guibu Division,

288
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,010
requests to join you.

289
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,510
Deng Xiang, Coffin Bearer of the Guibu Division,

290
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,210
requests to join you.

291
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,810
Zhao Kang, level-6 Spirit Officer of the Guibu Division,

292
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,640
requests to join you.

293
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,010
Zhou Zhengtai, Coffin Bearer...

294
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,010
Fang Jie, Coffin Guard...

295
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,610
Liu Baihu, Spirit Officer...

296
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,910
I'll head to Baihe to find Ling.

297
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,910
And I'll return home.

298
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,540
My father must know more details.

299
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,210
Okay.

300
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,910
I'll see you in Baihe.

301
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,210
Ding Xiao, level-9 Coffin Guard of the Guibu Division,

302
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,610
requests to join you.

303
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,810
I wonder how many disciples will fall in this expedition.
