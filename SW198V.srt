I will work hard, Teacher.

35
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,640
I will lead the Earth lineage

36

Episode 198
(Starry Tower)
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

45
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,900
Six thousand years ago,

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,840
I tried to warn King Quwu

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,050
to beware of King Tienson,

48
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,490
yet he still fell under the siege
of the demon clan.

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,140
All these years,

50
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,540
I used my true body under the alias
"King Samhoy"

51
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,900
to investigate everywhere.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,140
I found that the incidents where King Tienson's
teammates were ambushed

53
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,550
happened more than once.

54
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,510
It's just that every time, King Tienson
cleaned things up flawlessly,

55
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,570
leaving almost no survivors,

56
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,390
so no one ever discovered his true face.

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,140
He actually uses these despicable tricks.

58
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,830
Since he has provoked me,

59
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,670
there is no chance he'll escape alive.

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,160
Starry Tower,

61
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,320
search all human immortals inside.

62
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,830
Find this person.

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,860
There are currently 359 human immortals
inside the tower,

64
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,460
none matching this person's physical features.

65
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,870
None?

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,710
Search previous records.

67
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,450
According to records,

68
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,240
the human matching that description

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,220
left 1,800 years ago.

70
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,080
Master, what should we do now?

71
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,340
King Tienson is still a member
of the Hone Alliance.

72
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,070
I'll ask Queen Starphantom later.

73
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,940
We'll naturally discover his whereabouts.

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,790
But before that,

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,910
to ensure nothing goes wrong when we face
King Tienson,

76
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,820
we must first expand our power.

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,020
Who are we going to find for help?

78
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,710
The immortals of all races inside the tower.

79
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,550
A large-scale hunt

80
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,000
is about to begin.

81
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,410
Go!

82
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,280
This kind of attack can't kill me.

83
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,740
What?

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,310
Lost 52% of my immortal body?

85
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,160
Run!

86
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,250
Trying to control me?

87
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,800
No! No!

88
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,620
I'd rather fall!

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,150
Explode!

90
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,460
(To prepare for battling King Tienson,
who excels in soul-attacks,)

91
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,270
(I set my sights on)

92
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,480
(soul-type masters at peak King level
and above)

93
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,410
(and began the trials.)

94
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,500
(And I explored the power of the Star Map.)

95
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,980
(After several failures,)

96
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,150
(I finally subdued the first expert.)

97
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,270
(With the addition of King Liamson,)

98
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,610
(King Cushoo)
(our hunting success rate greatly increased.)

99
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,480
(King Junsong)

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,390
(Over the next month,)

101
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,040
(King Forsway)
(my followers rapidly grew to nine.)

102
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,530
(King Tetchy)
(The news of me)

103
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,480
(King Churtsan)
(slaughtering)

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,340
(King Jehong)
(countless aliens)

105
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,620
(King Beimay)
(spread quickly.)

106
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,850
(But because of this,)

107
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,180
(it also attracted more ambitious predators.)

108
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,170
(Of the nine,)

109
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,290
(King Liamson has the strongest soul ability.)

110
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,650
(King Camarrow previously got)

111
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,160
(the Purple Bell. King Forsway,)

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,560
(based on his fighting styles,)

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,730
(he is best suited for the new treasure,
the Ice-Soul Net.)

114
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,940
(These three can become my main force.)

115
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,110
Young,

116
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,050
I've found King Tienson's coordinates.

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,050
(Seventh Battlefield)
He's in the Twin Vortex Domain

118
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,480
(The Twin Vortex Domain)
of the Seventh Battlefield.

119
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,480
(Twin Vortex Domain, Seventh Battlefield)

120
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,940
King Bladeriver.

121
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,180
I knew that if you didn't die,
you'd be trouble.

122
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,010
I didn't expect that in just
six thousand years,

123
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,960
you'd become this terrifying.

124
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,220
Teleport?

125
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,850
King Forsway,

126
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,680
King Liamson, King Samhoy,

127
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,440
all limit king level.

128
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,940
These three are not to be provoked.

129
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,780
We're leaving.

130
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,870
Trying to escape?

131
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,030
Go all out.

132
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,970
Kill them all!

133
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,360
It's King Forsway's ultimate technique,
Forsway Sea.

134
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,420
Being enveloped by it severely limits
our movement.

135
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,640
Force your way out!

136
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,520
Ice-Soul Net!

137
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,830
Scatter!

138
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:50,254
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

139
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,450
- Swallowed Star -
- Starry Tower -

140
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,780
(Darn it!)

141
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,820
(I have to eliminate King Forsway first!)

142
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,910
The Purple Bell isn't just defense.

143
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,360
Let him taste its real power.

144
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,070
Demonic Flame Bell!

145
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,350
It's like snow meeting boiling water.

146
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,530
It can't resist at all.

147
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,480
Only 33% immortal body left!

148
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,350
I am attacked by an alien squad!

149
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,800
They have a heavy treasure!

150
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,040
Hurry, save me!

151
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,410
King Bladeriver!

152
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,240
I knew it was you.

153
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,640
King Tienson.

154
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,630
No! Never!

155
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,910
Master.

156
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,490
Where are the aliens?

157
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,300
The space has been sealed.

158
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,050
They couldn't have escaped
in such a short time.

159
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,800
Search.

160
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,180
(King Snowhorn)

161
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,410
Detected hidden signal.

162
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,030
So strong! Limit king level!

163
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
How dare you attack your own ally!?

164
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,810
It's King Bladeriver!

165
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,400
And King Tienson is also here!

166
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,540
I gave my all to rescue King Tienson.

167
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,770
Instead, I was attacked by my own people.

168
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,750
Misunderstanding!

169
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,670
We didn't know King Bladeriver arrived first!

170
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,110
Yes! We thought

171
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,620
an alien squad was hiding there!

172
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,740
Since King Tienson is unharmed,

173
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,380
we'll return to formation!

174
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,070
Remove the space seal now!

175
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,200
Wait.

176
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,350
Everyone, I just contacted the military system.

177
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,740
Guess what I found.

178
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,710
King Bladeriver is no longer in the system.

179
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,340
He's retired.

180
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,710
His tremendous wealth...

181
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,820
That means

182
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,810
we can...

183
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,070
King Bladeriver risked his life to save me,

184
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,920
and you dare plot against his treasures!?

185
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,230
King Tienson,

186
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,960
you'd better step aside.

187
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,060
King Tienson,

188
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,320
rest for now.

189
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,560
Leave everything to me.

190
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,960
King Bladeriver may be retired,

191
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,250
but he's still a human elite.

192
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,960
I've heard he was only peak king level,

193
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,370
yet he managed to slaughter
that many powerhouses.

194
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,790
He must have heavy treasures.

195
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,470
Interesting.

196
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,090
Hone Alliance members won't abandon
their principles.

197
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,730
Hone Alliance won't do anything,

198
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,830
but we aren't from the Hone Alliance.

199
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,670
Do it!

200
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,370
Die!

201
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,210
Good.

202
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,600
(You dare covet the treasure
with such meager power?)

203
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,160
Such strong space fluctuations!

204
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,370
What!?

205
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,280
Go to hell!

206
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,920
Kill him!

207
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,690
Shining Moon Strike!

208
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,820
You want to kill me?

209
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,910
Keep dreaming.

210
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,820
Heaven-Rending Claw!

211
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,020
No!!

212
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,880
(Darn it!)

213
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,430
(Just a moment and 35% of my immortal body
is gone!)

214
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,220
Die!

215
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,350
King Bladeriver!

216
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,860
(So fast!)

217
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,250
(The Wings of Slayer Wu can't dodge it.)

218
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,280
(Whip Shadow!)

219
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,740
(King Sevenswords!)

220
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,420
What!?

221
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,450
King Sevenswords.

222
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,480
You managed to survive one of my thrown swords.

223
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,400
You have some skill.

224
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,890
King Sevenswords, a powerhouse like you,

225
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,460
I've long wanted to test myself against you.

226
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,000
Good.

227
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,120
Come on.

228
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,660
(Twin Vortex Domain: the smaller)

229

(it reverses into repulsion.)

233
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,910
(No Kings have reached the core.)

234
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,170
(King Snowhorn, cold and ruthless.)

235
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,590
(A human powerhouse lacking
sense of camaraderie.)

236

(King Snowhorn, cold and ruthless.)

237

238

(It was named R136a1. Its mass is)

There's an immigrant ship approaching.

King Sevenswords, your sword seems slower.

No matter how capable he is,

he can't shake our foundation.

Louder.
