[Previously]
Creation God... Creation God...

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,799
Even after all these years
since your death...

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,079
you made such elaborate preparations.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,319
In that case...

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
let me see...

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,119
if the ending you hoped for...

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,839
can come true.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,599
Long Haochen...

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Long Haochen...

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,519
Go... become a god.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,639
Only a god...

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,879
can slay a god.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,879
Mother Goddess...

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,199
Mother Goddess...

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,199
Lord Electrolux left you
a final gift.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,439
Lord Electrolux left you
a final gift.

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,719
My dear disciple...

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,479
this is the path to godhood
I prepared for you.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,079
In legends of the Holy Demon Continent...

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
death...

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,639
is an endless, boundless river.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,359
Every drop...

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,079
is a departed soul.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,399
No matter how fierce the emotions...

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,559
no matter how unrelenting the regrets...

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,519
all fade in the River of the Dead...

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
dissolve away.

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,359
Like...

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,199
water vanishing into water.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Here...

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,199
is the final destination
of all living beings...

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,919
the end of every cycle.

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,799
The realm ruled solely...

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,959
by the God of Death.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,039
Sheng Cai'er...

36
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,239
you are my most cherished chosen.

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Today...

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,919
you shall command the Ferry of the Far Shore...

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,439
become the new God of Death.

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,999
Ruler over billions of souls...

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,999
in this vast River of the Dead...

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,359
their new sovereign.

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,359
The God of Death I remember...

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,039
was never this generous.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
I know...

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,759
compared to other gods' blessings...

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,359
mine is... different.

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,799
Some might even call it...

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,959
cruel.

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,239
But this river holds...

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,999
countless regrets and obsessions.

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,719
The greatest power...

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,039
yet the heaviest burden.

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,999
Without enduring the agony
of losing all six senses...

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,559
how could one bear
this entire river?

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,279
Since you've come...

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,559
you must be prepared.

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,319
So this time...

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,439
what do you want from me?

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,679
The River of the Dead...

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,879
bears souls of the entire world.

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,479
They must cleanse all obsessions...

63
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,279
within the river...

64
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,879
to reach the far shore of life.

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,919
The God of Death's duty...

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,479
is to ferry souls here.

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,239
But over countless ages...

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,279
five sinful souls escaped the river.

69
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,959
You want me to ferry them back?

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Yes.

71
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,559
Bring them back...

72
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,519
let their obsessions return
to the river.

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,879
let their obsessions return
to the river.

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,879
This...

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,119
is your trial.

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,439
This River of the Dead Pact...

77
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,239
will help you...

78
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,999
locate them.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,359
locate them.

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,119
But remember...

81
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,599
before the pact fully depletes...

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,959
complete the trial.

83
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,679
Or else...

84
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,039
godhood will forever elude you.

85
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,559
Go...

86
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,679
Sheng Cai'er.

87
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,679
When the river fills with souls...

88
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,279
a new god shall be born.

89
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Curse Crow Flower...

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,759
In the endless past...

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,079
even gods...

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,359
made mistakes.

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,599
Those mistakes...

94
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,479
became sins.

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,359
Divine Sin...

96
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,319
brings endless slaughter and death.

97
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,799
It grows by devouring
blood and carnage...

98
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,919
It grows by devouring
blood and carnage...

99
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Heart...

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,319
It hunts every living being
that discovers it.

101
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Like...

102
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,519
a born seed of evil.

103
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,239
You seem...

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,919
different from those fools.

105
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,479
Its body...

106
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,759
Do you think...

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,719
I'm guilty?

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,079
brims with sin and resentment.

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,799
For every life you took...

110
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,799
I'll repay you...

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
a hundredfold in agony.

112
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,119
You're no different from them.

113
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,359
None of you understand...

114
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,079
the joy of death.

115
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
His strength...

116
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,159
rivals the top fifteen Demon Gods.

117
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,839
Tear flesh...

118
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,479
shatter bone...

119
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,319
shatter bone...

120
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,639
scorch the soul...

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,839
burn the soul!

122
00:05:47,863 --> 00:06:03,163
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

123
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,639
When life fades, it rings out...

124
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,439
a melody the dull River of the Dead...

125
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,959
has never known.

126
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,839
I killed them...

127
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,519
as they slaughter cattle...

128
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,039
as they slaughter sheep.

129
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,639
Survival of the fittest...

130
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,559
the law of nature.

131
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,799
Even a god...

132
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,999
cannot purify me.

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
You...

134
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,439
don't deserve purification.

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,439
So vile and filthy...

136
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,919
you deserve only death.

137
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,719
What did you say?!

138
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
The River of the Dead...

139
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,239
No!

140
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
You can't kill me!

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,879
Ferry to Oblivion!

142
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,079
Go confess to those you slew.

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,919
Whose sin do you think I am?

144
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,119
Whose sin do you think I am?

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,679
I am the sin of Death itself!

146
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,039
Think becoming Death is easy?

147
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,119
Those words planted doubt
in Sheng Cai'er...

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,439
but she pressed on...

149
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,599
delving deeper...

150
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,239
into this so-called trial.

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,759
Unstoppable...

152
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,519
she finally reached...

153
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,519
the last sinful soul's domain.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,199
One moment, please.

155
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,439
The previous four sins...

156
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,039
brimmed...

157
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,599
with evil and hatred.

158
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,199
Yet this final one...

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,199
feels so serene.

160
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,839
You've come for me.

161
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm sorry...

162
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,039
I can't leave yet.

163
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,999
Don't come closer!

164
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Why?

165
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I sense...

166
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,719
no killing intent in you.

167
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,879
Then why stay?

168
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I...

169
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
don't remember.

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I only know...

171
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,199
this is my blood.

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
And...

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,519
there's something vital...

174
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,439
I can't leave yet.

175
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,519
But I can't recall it...

176
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,079
something crucial...

177
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,359
I must never forget.

178
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,719
I've lost precious memories too.

179
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Will you...

180
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,239
trust me?

181
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I remember now!

182
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,759
My daughter is waiting!

183
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Divine envoy...

184
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,319
thank you for restoring my memory.

185
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,799
Can you take me to her?

186
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Just to see her...

187
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,919
know she's well.

188
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Then...

189
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,999
I'll go with you to the river.

190
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,239
You're a good mother.

191
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,799
But I'm sorry...

192
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I can't.

193
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,599
Why?

194
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,359
In that brutal war...

195
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,839
your homeland...

196
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
was massacred.

197
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,079
Your daughter included.

198
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,199
All souls...

199
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,639
ferried to the river...

200
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,799
reborn anew.

201
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
You're the last.

202
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,039
So...

203
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,079
you can't...

204
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,039
see your daughter again.

205
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,999
But I can feel...

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,279
she hasn't vanished.

207
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,719
She hasn't vanished!

208
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,759
If she had...

209
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,119
that flower would be gone too.

210
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,679
But the flower remains.

211
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,879
I can sense it...

212
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,959
so my daughter lives!

213
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,639
She can't have vanished!

214
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,199
I don't know why...

215
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,279
you still sense...

216
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,439
your daughter's presence.

217
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,159
But...

218
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,719
I too have one...

219
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,959
who'd do anything for me.

220
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,879
I'll try with you.

221
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,479
Thank you...

222
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,879
Thank you!

223
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,199
To see my daughter...

224
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,839
I'll do anything.

225
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,199
Picture your deepest bond...

226
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,239
with your daughter.

227
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,999
I'll take you to her.

228
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Found her.

229
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Divine envoy...

230
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,279
my daughter's below!

231
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,279
Riverbed of the dead...

232
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
You sure?

233
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
No doubt.

234
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,799
I feel my daughter's aura.

235
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,479
Fine.

236
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Let's see.

237
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Where...

238
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,759
Where's my daughter?

239
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Riverbed of the dead...

240
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,079
holds only forgotten...

241
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
dissolved obsessions.

242
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,159
Your daughter can't be here.

243
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
No!

244
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,319
She's here for sure!

245
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
My daughter...

246
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
waits for me!

247
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,959
Looks like...

248
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,039
her longing's too deep...

249
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,799
causing illusions.

250
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,919
Over there!

251
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Someone there!

252
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,199
What?!

253
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,959
All souls...

254
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,039
should've been reborn by now...

255
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,439
They must cleanse obsessions here...

256
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,439
to reach life's far shore.

257
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,639
Death's duty...

258
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,199
is ferrying souls here.

259
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Child...

260
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
My child!

261
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,719
She...

262
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
wasn't reborn!

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Mama...

264
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Mama!

265
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,439
You said as long as the flower blooms...

266
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,919
you'd return.

267
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,799
So I've waited here.

268
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Sorry...

269
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,239
Mama failed you...

270
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,279
couldn't find you sooner.

271
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,799
But everyone...

272
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,759
was devoured by the river!

273
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
The river...

274
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,919
doesn't ferry souls to rebirth...

275
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,559
it imprisons them!

276
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Why?!

277
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,599
Sheng Cai'er...

278
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,159
You've found the final sin.

279
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Kill her...

280
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,119
and the trial ends.

281
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,879
She bears no sin!

282
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
The sinner...

283
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,279
is you!

284
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,799
Whose sin do you think I am?

285
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,399
I am Death's own sin!

286
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,959
Think becoming Death is simple?

287
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,119
As Death...

288
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,719
you should ferry souls...

289
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,639
yet you imprisoned them...

290
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,439
in endless torment!

291
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,159
That's your sin!

292
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,679
What sin have I?

293
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,079
By trapping souls in the river...

294
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,279
I absorb their power forever!

295
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,199
Eternal Death's might...

296
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,399
not fading like other gods!

297
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,479
Sheng Cai'er...

298
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,399
I'm teaching you how to be a god!

299
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,879
Then I'll teach you to be human!

300
00:18:45,903 --> 00:19:31,603
