Goddess,

60
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,200
you've obtained the power of the Lumina.

61
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,440
But the divine artifacts
are not yet complete.

62
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,600
Guess this is the end of you.

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,800
No… The Sacred Tree
absorbed demonic spirit as it slept.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
Lots of that spirit

65
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,640
still remains in it
beside the devine power.

66
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,480
In grief and anger,
the goddess absorbs it carelessly,

67
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,600
letting the demonic spirit enter her body,

68
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,240
awakening her inner demon.

69
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,240
Goddess, stop!

70
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,600
Breaking through with demonic spirit
and inner demon?

71
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,360
Delusional.

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,400
You think the inner demon
can be easily tamed?

73
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,600
Purity and corruption entangle,
channels reverse…

Everyone's here. What a lively scene.

84
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,440
I'll take my leave then.

85
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
Are those tears?

86
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
That's not like you.

87
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
It shouldn't be like this.

88

Long'er saved you again.

89
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,040
You finally got Shanhai back,
but he's dead.

90
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
You've trained so hard for sixty years,

91
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
yet lost even more than before.

92
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,080
The weak should all go to hell, right?

93
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,200
Yan Che was so driven by justice,

94
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,200
but every step he took met resistance.

95
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,840
How are you any different?

96
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,880
Chiyang Huaming saw you as a friend.

97
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,880
But you used her

98
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,560
for the sake of your revenge.

99
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,720
And Lu Qizhao,

100
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,160
a mind as deep as an abyss,
friend or enemy unknown.

101
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
He's your greatest threat.

102
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
And of course… you.

103
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,240
You failed to protect those who mattered.

104
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
You deserve to die most.

105

164
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
Fengyi Wenxue may be plotting against her.

165
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,440
She should be on guard.
