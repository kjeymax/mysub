1
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,071
Even if I die today...

2
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:29,031
...turn to ash and vanish...

3
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:31,550
...my Dao shattered forever...

4
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:33,071
...I will still—

5
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:35,269
—hold fast to my path.

6
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:40,188
I am the soul of an ancient demon.

7
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:41,427
I need you

8
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,347
to retrieve my soul fragments
from the other eight sacred relics.

9
00:00:45,147 --> 00:00:47,346
Help me become whole once more.

10
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:50,305
Destroy the Dao.

11
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,024
This crystal—

12
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,625
...born of obsession...

13
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:57,463
...will aid you
on your final journey.

14
00:00:58,304 --> 00:00:59,782
Seven hundred years
of seeking the Dao...

15
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:01,702
...and I’ve finally reached Ascension.

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,938
Little one...

17
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:15,138
This—

18
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:18,257
You think enduring heavenly wrath
was the end?

19
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:19,658
Now...

20
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,736
...the true trial begins.

21
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,255
Possession starts now.

22
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:25,936
Not a chance!

23
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,370
Your spirit...

24
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,410
...belongs to me.

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,369
For countless years...

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,168
...every cultivator
who reached Ascension here...

27
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,687
...has been devoured by me.

28
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,685
This technique is truly sinister.

29
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,604
If I hadn’t used killing intent
to anchor my mind...

30
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,683
...my soul would’ve been ripped out
by now.

31
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:09,564
I must leave—now.

32
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:12,162
This arm...

33
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:14,401
...somehow breached the immortal manor’s
barriers to reach here.

34
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,081
It can’t be ignored.

35
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:18,360
I’ve only just Ascended...

36
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,561
...my cultivation unstable.

37
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:21,479
I should seek the ancient demon first...

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,999
...and have him help me find
a secluded place to cultivate.

39
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:30,557
He broke free...

40
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:32,396
An inverse cultivator...

41
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:33,757
...truly troublesome.

42
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,595
This body is gravely wounded.

43
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:41,594
I need primal energy
to restore my cultivation.

44
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:43,673
But that energy...

45
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:47,192
...only appears when an outsider
achieves Ascension here.

46
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:51,551
A newly Ascended cultivator—
rare as a phoenix feather!

47
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:55,470
How could I possibly let him go?

48
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:05,907
My teleportation art—
it’s been disrupted!

49
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:08,506
Who the hell is this?

50
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:13,626
This is...

51
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:14,906
Crimson Madness Fruit.

52
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,904
Legend says it briefly boosts power...

53
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,143
...but awakens murderous intent.

54
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:22,062
At best—lose control...

55
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:23,063
...at worst—go mad with power.

56
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,662
At worst—fall to demonic madness.

57
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,141
I’ve seen this fruit
on the Vermilion Bird Star.

58
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,540
Didn’t expect it here
in the Demon Spirit Realm.

59
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,417
Persistent pest!

60
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,336
The Ominous Star has finally summoned me!

61
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,776
If I succeed this time...

62
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:47,015
...he’ll surely forgive
my past betrayal.

63
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:52,374
Who dares harm my master?!

64
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,452
Master!

65
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,172
Save me!

66
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:00,652
Save me!

67
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:01,893
Demonic Transformation!

68
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,169
This cursed thing—

69
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,569
—must be destroyed.

70
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:16,768
Something’s wrong.

71
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,567
That armor—
it’s the true source of demonic energy.

72
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:29,805
You...

73
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,723
...are mine.

74
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:33,884
Master, watch out!

75
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:40,241
Cycle of Life and Death!

76
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:07,473
That sound—

77
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:08,952
—truly repulsive.

78
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,992
In this daze...

79
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,552
...she’s the blade...

80
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:15,311
...and I’m the meat.

81
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,348
You’re mine.

82
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:31,987
I must...

83
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:34,505
...stay清醒.

84
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,784
If ordinary methods won’t work...

85
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,064
...then—

86
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,980
—I’ll crush it
with killing intent!

87
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,651
You...

88
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:55,603
Cycle of Rebirth...

89
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:57,922
...Annihilate!

90
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,918
Dare to shatter my art
with killing intent?

91
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,279
Madman!

92
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,317
This boy’s gone demonic.

93
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,396
The cost to capture him...

94
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:22,155
...might exceed the primal energy
he holds.

95
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,355
Taking him by force...

96
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,314
...just isn’t worth it.

97
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:27,795
Fine.

98
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:29,633
My accumulation
over millions of years...

99
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:30,994
...must not be risked.

100
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,352
Trying to run?

101
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,548
Found you.

102
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,707
M-Master!

103
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:51,947
Shouldn’t we...
tend to your wounds first?

104
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:53,588
What?

105
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,666
N-nothing!

106
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,185
What I meant was—

107
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:01,344
Now’s the perfect time to strike—
catch him off guard!

108
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:03,664
Oh no...

109
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:06,023
That Ominous Star from the Demon Sea
has returned!

110
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,224
No—

111
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:09,342
—he’s far more terrifying now.

112
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,741
Whoever dares disrupt my Ascension...

113
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,020
...must die.

114
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:33,055
A mere Ascendant—

115
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,135
—dares challenge me?

116
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:39,094
Ten Thousand Demons—
Devour His Heart!

117
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,249
Is this all you’ve got?

118
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:12,124
Back then, one drop of immortal wine
knocked you out for a year.

119
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:13,964
Now you gulp down four drops?

120
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:14,884
You’re insane!

121
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:20,362
Come on!

122
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,759
Good!

123
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:38,837
Even better!

124
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,229
His body is dead...

125
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,470
...his spirit shattered...

126
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:12,228
Yet fueled by Crimson Madness Fruit
and immortal energy...

127
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:13,667
...he’s gone utterly mad.

128
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,226
At this pace...

129
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:17,787
...as expected—

130
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:19,945
—he’s reached the Fire Demon Plains.

131
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,545
Such reckless arrogance...

132
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:25,504
The Fire Demon Realm
will surely take notice.

133
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,983
He’s walking straight to his death.

134
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,820
An Ascendant—

135
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,259
—and so gravely wounded...

136
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,778
Heaven-sent opportunity!

137
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:48,218
If I devour his Ascendant spirit...

138
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,777
...my sword spirit’s power
will surge beyond measure!

139
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,376
All troops—

140
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:53,696
—stand by. Rest in place.

141
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:57,375
Such fresh...

142
00:10:58,296 --> 00:10:59,454
...killing intent.

143
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:01,734
You’re badly injured,
sir—

144
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,013
why keep fighting?

145
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:03,453
Why keep fighting?

146
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:05,413
Thanks for the “medicine.”

147
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:11,171
Commander...

148
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,372
...is dead.

149
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:13,211
Kill him!

150
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,010
Avenge the commander!

151
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,929
Annihilation!

The Rat Division...

155
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:52,520
...has been annihilated.

156
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,038
He slaughtered 30,000 of our demon troops!

I—

158
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,797
—will have his heart and bones!

159
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,038

Summon 100,000 demon soldiers!

I’ll paint my realm
in that madman’s blood!

162
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:09,875
I’ll stain my lands
with his crimson!

163
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:15,473
Such potent killing intent...

164
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,032
You killed our commander...

165
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,391

draws upon 100,000 demon soldiers...

174
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:15,136
...and uses an Ascendant
as its core eye.

175
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:18,176
It can slaughter even peak Ascendants—

176
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:20,175
let alone you!

177
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,294
Forget late-stage Ascendants—

178
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,454
—this array kills them instantly!

179
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:33,493
All troops!

180
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:34,772
By the Emperor’s command—

181
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,410
—follow me!

182
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,370
...and tear him apart—

183
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:40,889
—leave not a soul!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

184
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,199
This killing intent...

185
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,198
...is intoxicating.

186
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:29,556
Impossible!

187
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:52,349
He’s trying to break the array
with brute force!

188
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,867
One Finger—Yellow Springs!

189
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:18,703
This can’t be!

190
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,221
He just reached Ascension—

191
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,181
—how can he already have his own Dao?!

192
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:24,220
Dao manifesting as Yellow Springs!

193
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,419
Today, empowered by Crimson Madness Fruit,
immortal wine...

194
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,219
...and the army’s bloodthirsty aura...

195
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,778
—he’s brushed the threshold
of the second step of the Heavenly Dao!

196
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:37,816
His will has solidified
into tangible reality!

197
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:39,777
Fascinating...

198
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:41,775
From this day forth—

199
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,774
—I, Wang Lin, will cultivate
neither Heaven nor Earth...

200
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,574
...neither immortals nor gods...

201
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:50,253
—I shall cultivate only my Dao.

202
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,132
Those who seek my death—

203
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,011
—enter my Yellow Springs.

204
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:58,411
Bathe in my Cycle of Rebirth.

205
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,250
Bound by neither Heaven nor Earth.

206
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,114
With only early-stage Ascendant power...

207
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:02,353
...he’s carved a river of Yellow Springs.

208
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,273
Wang Lin...

209
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,231
You truly astonish me.

210
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:09,912
Yuan.

211
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,469
Master, your command?

212
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,909
It’s time to greet our guest.

213
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:42,833
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™
