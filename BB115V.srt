With my master Qi Yuan's death,

If what Peng said is true,

175
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,480
why would the Tao of Heaven secretly
support the rise of the Demon Court?

176
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,380
What is the connection between Peng,

177
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,210
Hong Jun, and Senior Bold?

178
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Why did Hong Jun spread
the Primordial Spirit Taoism?

The more you know, the more danger you'll face.

I can't let you be dragged
into the huge mess.

Could this be Senior Bold's relic?

182
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,510
So weird.

183
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,380
Peng is from the Demon Court.

184
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,780
No matter how down-and-out he is, he shouldn't have so few treasures.

185
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,880
No Primordial Phoenix's origin power
was refined from his corpse either.

186
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,710
Peng's death raises too many questions.

187
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,380
Do you remember when he appeared?

188
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:46,810
Yes.

189
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,810
Master, after you and Immortal Yunxiao entered here, you triggered the outer warning seal.

190
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,010
Peng was alerted and rushed over.

191
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,350
As a fugitive hunted
by the Heavenly Court for years,

192
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,350
he didn't flee

193
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,950
when his cave's alarm went off.

194
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,950
Instead,

195
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,550
he chose to show himself.

196
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,580
You mean

197
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,950
he deliberately showed up?

198
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,450
What was his intention?

199
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,110
As a fugitive, what scares him most?

200
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,750
Being caught, of course.

201
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,910
You mean...

202
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,880
Only when the fake Peng is dead,

203
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,410
the real one could slip away.

204
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,150
Turns out Peng is quite the schemer.

205
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,710
Of course, that's likely only the first step of his plan.

206
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,210
The second step is probably
tied to the notebook.
