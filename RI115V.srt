29
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,630
(Previously on)
I learned of an old Immortal Mansion

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,630
If we enter successfully

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,030
We split the immortal treasures half and half

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,070
(These twelve seals may not be obstacles)

33
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,880
(But a great opportunity)

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,270
Take three of my sword strikes

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,470
Only then are you qualified to enter the Immortal Mansion

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,990
Blood Clan

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,280
Hope for ascension

38
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,830
Thank you, Daoist Yao

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,550
For helping me withstand two sword strikes

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,470
Master

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,150
Please enter the mansion

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,110
(The Immortal Wine is mellow)

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,230
(It can intoxicate the soul)

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,030
(I didn’t expect)

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,950
(This one drink)

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,590

[Storming the Palace]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,420
(Six months ago)

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,990
We can’t wait any longer

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,750
The Patriarch still hasn’t returned

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,510
Sima Yan’s men are getting restless

52
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,630
More and more unruly

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,870
It’s only a matter of time before they target us

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,500
Thirteen

55
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,950
I’ll ask you one last time

56
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,350
Are you leaving or not?

57
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,000
The Patriarch’s orders

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,750
Are to wait for him in the camp

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,110
Stubborn fool

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,230
Just sit and wait for disaster

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,510
I won’t stay with you

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,870
Tian Yao Province military rule number one

63

Anyone who deserts the camp

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,630
Is executed

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,460
I’m not one of your demon soldiers

66
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,070
My return to the tribe today has nothing to do with you

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Stop

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,350
Tian Yao Province military rule number eight

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,150
Anyone who defies their superior

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,790
Is executed

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,950
The Patriarch is the commander of this camp

72
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,260
Wait for his return

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,470
Today’s events will be investigated

74
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,350
Such a loyal dog

75
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,190
Too bad your useless master has been dismissed

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,470
He won’t come to save you

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,110
Jerk

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,790
You can kill me

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,110
But you cannot insult the Patriarch

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,750
Courting death

(He Kun, new Black Armor Camp leader, 100,000 demon power, Nascent Soul Transformation mid-stage)

84
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,650
(How did I get drunk?)

85
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,550
(I don’t know how long I slept)

86
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,340
(Wang Lin’s avatar, Nascent Soul Transformation peak)

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,580
(My cultivation)

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,070
(Just one drop of Immortal Wine)

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,990
(Helped me reach Nascent Soul Transformation peak)

90
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,030
(The remaining nine drops)

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,950
(Must be stored carefully)

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,790
(Take control of the Immortal Mansion)

93
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,470
(Break through cultivation)

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,190
(And Yao Xixue’s storage pouch)

95
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,230
(This adventure)

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,430
(Was truly rewarding)

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,550
(With my current cultivation)

98
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,390
(I can easily break Yao Xixue’s spiritual mark)

99
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,950
(This is—

100
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,950
(All are immortal jades)

101
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,230
(These immortal jades)

102
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,150
(Will help me reach the top in the future)

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,420
(Half an hour later)

104
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,750
(These three storage pouches)

105
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,230
(Have over a thousand blood talismans)

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,670
(Several blood soul pills, real or fake unknown)

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,990
(And even a blood compass for entering and leaving)

108
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,950
(Such strong killing intent)

109
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,920
(No, that’s not right)

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,350
(On this restriction

111
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,870
(Should be her father’s spiritual mark)

112
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,270
(If an outsider opens it)

113
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,590
(They’ll be instantly killed by this spiritual mark)

114

(Blood Ancestor)

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,470
(Such a clever trick)

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,070
(This teleportation array was just inscribed)

117
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,790
(Li, Qian)
(Must have been Yao Xixue’s doing earlier)

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,150
(Blood Ancestor sent her to set up the teleportation array here)

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,870
(Reinforcements will surely come later)

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,990
(Li)
(Erase the array directly)

121
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,670
(It might be noticed)

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,470
(So instead)

123
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,550
(If someone from Blood Star really teleports here)

124
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,550
(These restrictions)

125
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,190
(Can give them a surprise)

126
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,670
Sir, you command the troops well

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,390
In your half year in charge

128
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,990
Everyone in Black Armor Camp is convinced

129
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,870
Looks like my camp

130
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,340
Has changed hands

131
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,340
Wang Lin

132
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,070
He

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,230
How did he come back?

134
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,350
Dares to barge into my camp

135
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,390
(He)
Kill on sight

136
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,940
First battalion ready

137
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,660
Second battalion ready

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,140
Third battalion ready

139
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,230
Fourth battalion ready

140
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,030
Retreat

141
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,980
(He)

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,590
(What realm has this person's cultivation reached?)

143
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,350
(Only when facing the Demon General himself)

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,230
do you feel such overwhelming pressure.

145
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,230
What exactly are your intentions?

146
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,950
This is my barracks.

147
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,350
What do you think I intend to do?

148
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,390
(He)
You've been missing for over a year.

149
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,990
The Demon General has long dismissed you
from your command.

150
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,590
(So I was in that Immortal Mansion)

151
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,630
for a whole year.

152
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,630
Where is my attendant?

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,430
(If I retreat now,)

154
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,430
I'll lose my position as commander.

155
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:26,054
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

156
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,230
Your shell

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,190
isn't tough enough.

Nascent Soul Transformation

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,590
Great Perfection

160
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,630
You tell me.

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,150
Six months after you left,

162
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,510
the two of them disappeared.

163
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,140
I don't know where they went either.

164
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,670
Stop!

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,910
This person has a unique physique.

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,790
He might be useful to the Demon General.

167
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,270
Sir.

168
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,550
That Hu Pao is nowhere to be seen today.

169
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,690
Fine.

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,230
Alright.

171
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,550
Where is Thirteen being held?

172
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,030
You mean that brute who trains his body?

173
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,190
The Demon General ordered

174
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,150
to find people with strong bodies.

175
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,950
I thought that brute fit the criteria.

176
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,550
So I sent him to the Demon General's manor.

177
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,430
Commander Wang,

178
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,670
if you want to kill or torture me,

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,550
I, He Kun, won't even blink.

180
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,470
But if you want someone,

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,350
go ask the Demon General yourself.

182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,510
You saved Thirteen's life,

183
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,470
then handed him to the Demon General.

184
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,190
Your merits and faults cancel out.

185
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,790
I won't kill you.

186
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,990
The Demon General has been in seclusion
for half a year.

187
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,230
He refuses all visitors.

188
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,790
If you break into the palace,

189
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,030
you'll die for sure.

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,390
(As expected,)

191
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,750
(the teleport arrays to the Demon General's manor
are all shut down.)

192
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,030
(If I want to rescue Thirteen,)

193
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,550
(I must break through the six gates
of Ancient Demon City head-on.)

194
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,630
The Demon General is in seclusion.

195
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,150
This gate is under strict guard.

196
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,830
Take one more step,

197
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,470
and you'll be killed without mercy.

198
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,910
Demon General,

199
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,870
Wang Lin requests an audience.

200
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,220
(Ancient Demon City)

201
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,750
(I brought Thirteen and Hu Pao
to Ancient Demon City.)

202
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,590
(My unexpected slumber in the Immortal Mansion
dragged them into this.)

203
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,350
(I may have endangered their lives.)

204
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,800
(A cultivator)

205
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,830
(should avoid trouble)

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,790
(and seek heavenly fortune.)

207
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,670
(To fight and storm the palace for strangers,)

208
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,150
(defy the Demon General,)

209
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,830
(challenge the Tian Yao Army's rules,)

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,310
(is not worth it.)

211
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,310
(But in this world,)

212
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,470
(some things must be done,)

213
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,770
(and some must not.)

214
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,150
Fire!

215
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,470
(I, Wang Lin, walk between heaven and earth,)

216
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,350
(not seeking to follow rules,)

217
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,470
nor to pursue the heavenly path.

218
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,460
I only wish

219
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,280
to live without regret.

220
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,150
Someone is breaking into the palace!

221
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,150
Quick, inform all the commanders!

222
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,630
This is a demon crystal I found
in the other tribe.

223
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,110
I offer it specially to the Immortal.

224
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,950
Those who disrespect the Patriarch

225
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,040
are all enemies.

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,670
You may kill me,

227
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,870
but you must not insult the Patriarch.

228
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,710
(Bound by human ties,)

229
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,550
(bound by obsession,)

230
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,950
(maybe I'm not suited for cultivation.)

231
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,790
(But once obsession arises,)

232
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,750
(I must act on it.)

233
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,840
Patriarch.

234
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,190
(If I don't save Thirteen today,)

235
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,360
The Patriarch is the chief commander
of this camp.

236
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,880
- (What I, Wang Lin, seek in life)
- is to wait for his return.

237
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,430
Today's events will be investigated.

238
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,240
(will become empty wishes.)

239
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,800
Charge!

240
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,140
♪I defy fate, become immortal, and battle the heavens♪

241
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,150
How dare you!

242
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,590
The Demon General is in seclusion.

243
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,620
Wang Lin!

244
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,350
What are you trying to do?

245
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,150
I want to see the Demon General.

246
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,750
I demand justice for Thirteen.

247
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,030
You're insane!

248
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,030
You destroy my city gates,

249
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,030
break our city rules,

250
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,390
and make enemies of all Ancient Demon City,

251
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,630
just for a servant as insignificant as an ant.

252
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,790
You've got some nerve!

253
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,350
(Li Tao, First Commander of Ancient Demon City,
150,000 armored demon power, Nascent Soul late stage)
Since you refuse to listen,

254
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,110
then today

255
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,350
will be the day you die.

256
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,870
Prepare to die!

257
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,910
Yellow Springs!

258
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,950
(Here it comes.)

259
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,190
Nascent Soul Transformation, Great Perfection.

260
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,950
Finger technique divine power.

261
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,390
Not bad.

262
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,870
But that's not enough to spare your life.

263
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,230
It's still not enough.

264
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,510
Demon General,

265
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,510
long time no see.

266
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,150
Take this move, Hundred Waves of Demon Sea.

267
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,870
Only then are you qualified to speak before me.

268
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,270
(The power of this Hundred Waves of Demon Sea)

269
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,990
(is far greater than the previous Ten Collapse Fist.)

270
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,830
Can't handle it already?

271
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,070
Show me your true skills.

272
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,830
(Is this...)

273
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,550
(a golden talisman?)

274
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,350
(Why does it shake my soul so much?)

275
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,870
(As if it's about to burst out of my body.)

276
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,630
(The rune activates on its own now.)

277
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,950
(It must be a protective divine power.)

278
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,190
(This power came from the Immortal Mansion.)

279
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,950
(Might as well let it activate freely.)

280
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,470
(Maybe it can withstand the Hundred Waves of Demon Sea.)

281
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,790
(This move drains the Mark of Life too much.)

282
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,950
(Hard to use repeatedly.)

283
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,990
Good.

284
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,270
Wang Lin.

285
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,150
I underestimated you.

286
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,830
This rune seems to have many changes left.

287
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,470
Show me all you've got.

288
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,590
Let’s fight to our hearts’ content.

289
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,160
Thirteen.

290
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,550
Where is he?

291
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,950
We’ll talk after the fight.

292
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,070
Hundred Waves Thunder Rush!

293
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,630
Raging Tide Surge!

294
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,950
Fight!

295
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,750
(Be it Ten Collapse Fist or Hundred Waves of Demon Sea,)

296
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,750
(his techniques)

297
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,750
(all stem from his indomitable fighting spirit.)

298
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,390
(Divine powers alone can’t win.)

299
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,150
(It seems)

300
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,670
(there’s only one move left to gamble on.)

301
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,750
If you press me this hard,

302
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,390
if I use my killing blow,

303
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,990
you’ll surely die.

304
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,790
If you can kill me,

305
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,950
I, Mo, will admit defeat.

306
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,350
I’ve cultivated for many years.

307
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,150
Never seen anyone withstand Demon General’s move.

308
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,950
It’s a pity for such a gifted young man.

309
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,190
He barged in relying on his cultivation.

310
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,150
Unaware of Demon General’s true might,

311
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,350
which is far beyond mere cultivation.

312
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,630
This kid

313
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,150
brought this on himself.

314
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,990
This is...

315
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,790
the power of a Celestial Palm.

316
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,070
Borrowing the east wind to shatter his spirit.

317
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,430
This divine technique—

318
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,350
you haven’t mastered it yet, have you?

319
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,170
You—

320
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,870
Why not try again?

321
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,870
(Such a divine power,)

322
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,950
(if used with Nascent Soul Transformation cultivation,)

323
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,470
(will surely cause severe backlash.)

324
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,790
(That’s why he only cast a phantom palm.)

325
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,750
(In just one year,)

326
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,350
(his cultivation rivals mine.)

327
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,350
(His powers are even more unfathomable.)

328
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,270
General Mo.

329
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,790
Can you tell me now—

330
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,350
Thirteen—

331
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,670
where is he?

332
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,150
No need to be so formal.

333
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,390
Brother Wang.

334
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,030
From now on, we’ll call each other brothers.

335
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,550
This time, my seclusion

336
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,150
was to refine the bodies of the strong.

337
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,230
Your follower was last in line.

338
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,630
He hasn’t been refined yet.

339
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,070
I can return him to you.

340
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,070
But you stormed the palace today,

341
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,030
destroyed my city towers,

342
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,270
I can’t let it go so easily.

343
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,130
What will you do?

344
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,870
In three months,

345
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,150
at Tian Yao City, capital of Tian Yao Province,

346
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,430
among all the Demon Generals,

347
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,550
there will be a Demon General Tournament.

348
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,070
Brother Wang,

349
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,950
I want you to help me.

350
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,670
(Though he’s domineering,)

351
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,350
(he’s truly genuine.)

352
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,110
Alright.

353
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,590
From today on,

354
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,080
Wang Lin

355
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,550
is my First Deputy Commander.

356
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,590
If I win the Demon General Tournament,

357
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,790
I’ll ask the Demon Emperor for a general’s title for you.

358
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,580
One hundred thousand armored troops,

359
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,550
