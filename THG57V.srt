3
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,790
Hey, you.

4
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,830
Are you following the series?

5
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,160
Have you dropped a coin

6
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,160
and smashed that like button?

7
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,890
Please,

8
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,460
give us that triple support!

9
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm begging you!

(Mount Shenglin Chapter)
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

15
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,690
(Hall of the Imperial Academy)
His Majesty's decree:

16
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,150
"Gu Li'nuan, upright in nature
and versed in the classics and histories,

17
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,810
is hereby appointed Grand Chancellor
of the Imperial Academy, overseeing all its affairs.

18
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,060
May you nurture worthy talent

19
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,590
and live up to my expectations."

20
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,900
I will give my life for the cause and serve until death!

21
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,150
I received news from the Imperial Academy.

22
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,500
The new Grand Chancellor is Gu Li'nuan.

23
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,740
His learning and virtue are far from sufficient,

24
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,660
but this is something

25
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,970
I cannot question.

26
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,230
My power has grown too great.

27
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,390
It is only natural that His Majesty harbors concern.

28
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,560
Otherwise, even I would feel uneasy.

29
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,060
Present the matter of the Heavenly Demon Sect's
new Sect Master to His Majesty.

30
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,490
As for the former Grand Chancellor's true identity,

31
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,060
leave that unspoken.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,570
Now that you are the Sect Master,

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,010
what do you plan to do first?

34
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,960
Establish the 361st hall,

35
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,430
the Hall of Learning.

36
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,270
I know you like tearing things down.

37
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,180
I had no problem with you
dismantling the Scholars' Quarters,

38
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,230
but you must never

39
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,330
take anything apart on Mount Shenglin.

40
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,050
I don't tear things down that often.

41
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,340
Right, right.

42
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,650
You were at the Imperial Academy for less than eight days,

43
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,610
and you only took apart two or three buildings

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,160
before heading beyond the border for more damage.

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,269
Every hall and palace here is an ancient site

46
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,089
engraved with cultivation techniques

47
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,590
for all disciples to learn.

48
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,690
There is no need to hoard knowledge.

49
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,760
Mastering it is what truly matters.

50
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,570
Stop here, Sect Master.

51
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,160
This farewell will be forever.

52
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,700
No matter how far you walk with me,
we must part at some point.

53
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,760
Grandmaster,

54
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,190
these are the treasures I took from the Golden Palace.

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,430
Trade them for travel expenses.

56
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,830
I also prepared some tonics.

57
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,760
The bottles are categorized by solar terms.

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,990
Take the white ones on the Spring Equinox,
and the blue ones on Frost's Descent.

59
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,800
Here's a bucket of Nine-Dragon Carp I just caught.
They're still fresh.

60
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,790
These are the peace knots I made by myself,

61
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,160
along with some thick robes and shoes...

62
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,990
Thank you, Grandmaster,

63
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,340
for your century of teaching

64
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,110
and a lifetime of guidance!

65
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,110
We bid you farewell!

66
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,530
Village Chief,

67
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,260
have you been lying like this for the past two days?

68
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,040
Did you stay here even when the darkness fell?

69
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,530
Apothecary, something's been bothering you.

70
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,840
You used to send me home every evening,

71
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,180
but yesterday, you forgot.

72
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,550
Couldn't you walk or fly back by yourself?

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,960
How? Remember

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,780
that I have neither legs nor arms.

75
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,130
You possess immense power.

76
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,590
Even the darkness couldn't kill you.

77
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,750
And now you're playing the helpless old man with me?

78
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,790
I was simply too lazy to move.

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,430
My fault.

80
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,100
(Canlao Village)

81
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,830
It is always a pleasure to greet a friend from afar!

82
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,990
My friend,

83
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,060
you are now free of burdens.

84
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,180
(Hall of the Sage's Heart)

85
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,370
After receiving the teachings from the woodcutter sage,

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,740
the Sect Master should develop their own
Great Unity Technique

87
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,150
to harmonize all the techniques
in "The Ultimate Heavenly Demon Codex".

88
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,820
(Soul-Summoning Guide)
Mount Shenglin, far removed from the clamor of the world,

89
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,130
is the perfect place for such enlightenment.

90
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,210
(Talismanic Script of Ghost and Spirit Command)

91
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,350
The Sect Master, raised by all of you,

92
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,380
is exceptionally bright

93
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,360
and was born with the Domineering Body.

94
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,860
Yet my knowledge is limited.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
I had never heard of such a physique,
so I came to seek guidance.

96
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,140
Looks like we even fooled
the Grandmaster of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

97
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,490
Pardon my rudeness.

98
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,060
Here's the truth

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,030
behind the so-called Domineering Body.

100
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,150
Developing the Great Unity Technique
cannot be achieved in a day or two.

101
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,830
The Grandmaster likely meant for the Sect Master

102
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,960
to master another supreme art of our sect
as soon as possible.

103
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,200
You mean the teleportation art?

104
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,060
It requires extremely high skill in numerology.

105
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,830
The Sect Master is still young. It may be difficult for him.

106
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,390
He's forged a teleportation artifact already?

107
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,810
Does his rapid progress have to do
with his Domineering Body?

108
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,560
(Phoenix Pavilion)
This is the Phoenix Pavilion of our sixth Sect Master!

109
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,460
Please, Sect Master, stop tearing things down!

110
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,660
Sect Master,

111
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,230
the teleportation art is dangerous
and consumes Vital Energy rapidly.

112
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,060
With your current stage,

113
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,260
you can teleport only three or four times at most,

114
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,790
each time no more than 200 zhang.

115
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,160
If you run out of Vital Energy halfway,
you can get stuck inside a wall or a tree!

116
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,130
- Look out!
- You should confirm the destination before teleporting.

117
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,940
If you end up in a forbidden zone,

118
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,390
you might die without even leaving a body behind!

119
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,520
I understand now.

120
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,890
I need to determine each destination first

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,310
and then link them together

122
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,110
to teleport accurately.

123
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,990
The Sect Master's Domineering Body is really something.

124
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,460
Such rapid mastery is probably something

125
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,980
that even the Grandmaster did not expect.

126
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:28,104

(Tales of Herding Gods Season 3)

128
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,980
So his so-called Domineering Body

129
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,130
is actually nothing extraordinary.

130
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,730
But he believes in it with unshakable confidence

131
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,630
and has beaten so many talents and geniuses,
making them flee in disgrace.

132
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,250
What about the Domineering Body Triple-Elixir Skill
he practices? There must be something unique about it.

133
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,870
The Triple-Elixir Skill

134
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,320
is simply the most basic Guiding Skill
to keep healthy in the old era.

135
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,960
If only ordinary people before the disaster

136
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,900
could practice this technique,

137
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,010
then how did the Sect Master awaken his Mortal Body?

138
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,650
Was he born before the disaster?

139
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,360
Where was Mu really born?

140
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,130
Carefree Township.

141
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,270
Where is this Carefree Township?

142
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,980
If you are interested, my friend,

143
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,360
we can

144
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,490
leave the village tonight

145
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,760
and search for it in the darkness
at the source of the Yong River.

146
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,390
Do not damage the sacred tree!

147
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,660
He's developed his own Great Unity Technique!

148
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,290
When did you all arrive?

149
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,050
"To follow one's true will
and live in full accord with nature

150
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,520
is the Way."

151
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,780
Sect Master, the way you immerse yourself in the Way
is truly remarkable.

152
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,590
King Lu, you flatter me.

153
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,360
Mr. Qin, you must be hungry.

154
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:12,940
Here.

155

These pheasants were raised by the former Saintess.

156
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,890
Grandma Si raised them?

157
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,160
Too bad someone ate half of the Nine-Leaf Lingzhi

158
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,930
in the Medicine King Hall.

159
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,760
Otherwise, we could use it to nourish you.

160
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,890
I just remembered.

161
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,990
As an Erudite of the Academy,
I've barely attended any classes there.

162
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,960
I plan to leave today.

163
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,390
In every sense, we should ask you to stay longer,

164
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,260
but your studies come first.

165
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,430
We won't keep you.

166
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Your studies come first.

167
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,190
Do come back often...

168
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,990
I will.

169
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,720
This new Sect Master is really something.

170
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,060
The teleportation art relies on numerology,

171
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,180
and the Great Unity Technique depends on comprehension.

172
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,000
Yet he mastered both in just over ten days.

173
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,200
Such talent and insight are rarely seen in the world.

174
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,260
True.

175
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,140
But he still can't match the Imperial Preceptor,

176
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,870
a sage seen once in five centuries.

177
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,960
That's not necessarily true.

178
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,450
We only know what we've witnessed.

179
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,740
He may have grasped even more.

180
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,730
I can't wait to see him

181
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,060
lead our sect to new glory.

182
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,580
Our holy land is now above Guazhou?

183
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,110
Lately, the imperial relatives of Yankang
have rebelled there.

184
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,400
Sect Master!

185
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,190
My lord,

186
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,300
a kid popped out of nowhere.

187
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,960
No need to be alarmed.

188
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,000
I just want a ride to the capital.

189
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,460
From Guazhou to the capital?

190
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,890
That'll be 100 Dafeng coins.

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,420
That much?

192
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,560
Where else will you find such a fair price?

193
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,430
Times are hard. There's war every day. Danger is everywhere.

194
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,480
We risk our lives with every trip,

195
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,490
so of course we charge more.

196
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,560
These people don't look like proper boatmen.

197
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,860
They're clearly bandits!

198
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,610
Please, sir, take the honored seat!

199
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,700
Do you feel good?

200
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,090
Sir,

201
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,170
after my father visited the Imperial Preceptor that night,

202
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,490
the Three-Marvel Fort in Guazhou,

203
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,660
the Liqing Palace in Linzhou,

204
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,460
and the Beggar Sect in Pingzhou all rebelled.

205
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,790
I heard Emperor Yanfeng was so enraged

206
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,130
that he sent Consort Che, who came
from the Three-Marvel Fort, into a cold palace.

207
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,050
Send my words to all the sects.
Gather forces on the Southern Border.

208
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,190
The Imperial Preceptor has let this rebellion drag on.

209
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,290
When will he act?

210
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,490
It's the insect army of the Three-Marvel Fort!

211
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,060
Change course!

212
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,330
Increase firepower!

213
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,530
Full speed ahead!

214
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
What great swordsmanship!

215
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,960
I am Fan Yunxiao.

216
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,690
Are you from the Yuyuan clan?

217
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,380
I'm Qin Mu. I'm from the Imperial Academy.
