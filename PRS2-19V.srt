(Previously)
Why do you have Blood Eye too?

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,079
Because

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,239
We are the same kind

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,479
Lu Di

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,479
These two hundred fifty thousand troops

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,199
How do you plan to handle them?

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,359
Talan Fortress

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,919
And my fifty thousand soldiers

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,919
I can help Your Highness make them surrender

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,119
Defend the city

32
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,279
We do not accept Demon Race's surrender

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,479
And we won't help that darn Lu Di

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,559
defend Talan Fortress

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,119
You lead your troops over

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,359
I'll handle the supplies

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,719
Attack the city

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,439
What's happened?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,199
Lu Di's men have rebelled

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,799
Confiscate their weapons

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,039
Send them to the POW camp

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,039
Duke

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,119
Those Jinglan Towers

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,599
My Lord

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,519
Leave it to me

Episode 19
(Talan Battle, Part 2)
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,440
(Imperial Year 782, June 27)

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,959
Hurry

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,639
Hurry

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,239
This darn weather

52
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,119
Has delayed us almost a day again

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,079
No idea how things are for My Lord

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,159
No routed troops along the way

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,599
Means the fortress is still ours

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,919
Roger

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,679
I have an idea

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,559
Baichuan

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,999
You're not my type

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,079
I like

61
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,999
Alright

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,679
Go ahead

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,239
Talan Fortress is besieged by Ross

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,559
If we enter now

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,319
Aren't we walking into a trap?

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,919
You mean

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,279
We split our forces

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,639
I bypass Talan Fortress

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,839
and strike directly at Ross's rear

70
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,239
(Talan Fortress)
Attack with My Lord from both sides

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,399
You lead the Huo Regiment to raid Yalu City behind Ross

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,239
Without supplies from there

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,479
Ross, win or lose

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,959
can't stay in the Far East

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,639
Good idea

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,719
But detouring

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,159
may cost us another half day

78
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,919
When in the field

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,039
Act as needed in emergencies

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,319
It's settled

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,839
If My Lord blames us, I'll take it

82
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,740
(Ross Legion, Oule Legion, King of Light Legion)

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,398
Once the enemy is in range

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,119
Open fire for cover immediately

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,839
Yes

86
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,839
Brothers

87
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,199
See those big ones?

88
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,479
- Yes
- Yes

89
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,279
Take them down

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,260
Fire

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,279
Cease fire

92
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,279
Get ready to blast 'em

93
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,599
Bring the bow

94
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,460
Zhaocai

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,599
Take out the Jinglan Towers

96
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,479
- Yes
- Yes

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,119
Storm

98
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,319
is coming soon

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,959
My Lord means

100
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,759
we're in for a tough fight?

101
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,839
Darn tough fight

102
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,799
Once it rains

103
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,919
How do we burn the Jinglan Towers?

104
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,279
Archers

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,199
Fire!

106
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,239
My Lord

107
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,039
Enemy is two hundred meters from the north gate

108
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,199
Could attack any moment

109
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,719
My Lord

110
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,919
Rebels inside the city are rioting again

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,199
Your Highness

112
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,959
We can't do this without you

113
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,239
(Baichuan)

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,959
(Why aren't you here yet?)

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,199
Green-skinned Barbarians

116
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,559
Come on

117
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,319
Green-skinned Barbarians

118
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,319
I'll give you good food

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Zhaocai

120
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,839
We

121
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,479
didn't let My Lord down

122
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,319
Lord

123
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,439
What now?

124
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,959
Send in all our troops

125
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,239
I don't believe

126
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,999
two hundred thousand troops

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,359
can't take Talan Fortress

128
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,300
(Ross Legion, Oule Legion, King of Light Legion)

129
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,319
What is that darn Oule doing?

130
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,279
Why aren't they attacking?

131
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,959
Lord

132
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,839
Stop fighting

133
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
Let our Tarta Tribe survive

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,279
Oule is clearly sending us to die

135
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,239
So you think

136
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,839
Who should be sent to suppress the rebellion?

137
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,479
So it's Your Majesty's scheme

138
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,159
No wonder

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,439
No wonder

140
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,079
Retreat

141
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,079
Third Regiment

142
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,799
Retreat

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,519
Hurry

144
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,039
They're retreating

145
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,519
Finally, they've retreated

146
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,999
Follow me out of the city

147
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,919
Yes

148
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,479
Why leave the city?

149
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,439
Take the brothers

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,279
home

151
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,359
What about the battering logs?

152
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,519
The full assault is about to begin.

153
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,439
Gu Lei.

154
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,079
Move all the troops from the north gate.

155
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,359
Th-th-then...

156
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,959
What about the north gate?

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,599
Lu Di.

158
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,119
What about those rebel soldiers?

159
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,719
They're here.

160
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,959
You don't mean to have them defend the city?

161
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,279
Make them all stand on the city wall.

162
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,759
Don't issue them any weapons.

163
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,039
Yes.

164
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,679
(Baichuan)

165
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,719
Attack the city!

166
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,839
- Sem Hei Lin!
- Sem Hei Lin!

167
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,559
Lord.

168
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,279
Lord.

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,359
What is it?

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,759
The east gate has launched a full assault.

171
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,799
What should we do?

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,079
Should we attack the city?

173
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,959
How are the Tarta Tribe's casualties?

174
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,279
Heavy losses.

175
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,079
Ross has been like a madman these days.

176
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,519
He keeps sending waves of attacks.

177
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,319
At least a third of their forces are lost.

178
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,599
No rush.

179
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,439
Wait until their casualties are over half.

180
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,039
Then we'll make our move.

181
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,399
Yes.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,839
Kill!

183
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,679
Kill!

(Ross Legion, Oule Legion, King of Light Legion)

185
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,159
Hold the line!

186
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,919
I'll fight you to the end!

187

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,759
Hold fast!

189
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,879
Hang in there!

190
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,039
The gate is breached!

191
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,159
The gate is breached!

192
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,719
- Long live the King of Light!
- Long live the King of Light!

- Kill all these green-skinned bastards!
- Kill all these green-skinned bastards!

Lord.

197
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,639
A large Far East Army is charging from the rear.

198
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,519
What?

199
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,239
Feng Regiment, listen up!

200
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,799
Left wing, follow me to aid the east gate.

201
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,519
Right wing, strike straight at the north gate enemy.

202
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,199
Yes.

203
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,999
Then...

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,559
Are those our people?

205
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,879
Hold formation.

206
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,599
Enemy reinforcements have arrived.

207
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,719
Counterattack out of the city!

208
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,399
Wait for my command!

209
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,439
Lord.

210
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,119
Retreat.

211
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,639
Retreat!

212
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,799
Enemy attack!

213
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,559
Regroup and counterattack!

214
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,679
Where is everyone?

215
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,919
Hold your weapons tight.

216
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,439
Lord.

217
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,119
This is bad!

218
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,399
The Far East Army is attacking!

219
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,719
Where did the Far East Army come from?

220
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,119
Quick, protect the Lord and break out!

221
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,079

My Lord.

224
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,159
Bai...

225
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,999
General Baichuan and his men...

226
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,279
...are coming.

227
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,159
Second Division, clear the battlefield quickly.

228
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,839
Everyone else, assemble at once.

229
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,639
Follow me into the city.

230
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,479
Bai... Bai...

231
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,399
Just get to the point.

232
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,919
M-my Lord said...

233
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,319
...for you to...

234
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,879
...set up camp outside the city.

Lord Baichuan.

238
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,119
...is outside.

239
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,919
Let her in.

240
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,039
Yes.

241

(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

242
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,199
My Lord.

243
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,599
Is something the matter?

244
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,479
Baichuan is here to ask for forgiveness.

245
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,919
You have done nothing wrong.

246
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,319
You saved us.

247
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,199
You saved Talan Fortress.

248
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,639
You deserve merit.

249
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,279
I missed the marching date.

250
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,719
I was two days late.

251
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,399
Because of the heavy rain.

252
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,639
I know.

253
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,599
I changed the marching route on my own.

254
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,319
I didn't follow your orders.

255
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,959
I didn't come to Talan Fortress to join forces.

256
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,759
Baichuan.

257
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,119
Do you know...

258
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,639
Duke is dead.

259
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,479
I know.

260
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,839
Then why didn't you come as I ordered?

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,239
If it were you, My Lord...

262
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,239
...what would you have done?

263
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,639
If you had entered the city earlier...

264
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,559
...maybe Duke and the others would have survived.

265
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,079
As for military tactics...

266
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,319
I don't want to explain further.

267
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,519
You know more about this than I do.

268
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,679
All I can say...

269
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,639
...is I made the best choice.

270
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,759
In your mind...

271
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,479
...the lives of those soldiers...

272
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,079
...whose lives matter more or less?

273
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,039
The higher your position...

274
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,479
...the fewer choices you have.

275
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,439
That's what you said before.

276
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,839
You're right.

277
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,980
Get up.

278
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,719
My Lord.

279
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,719
There's something I shouldn't say...

280
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,799
Since you returned from Shangdu...

281
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,439
...you've become...

282
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,919
...cold and suspicious.

283
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,839
Is that so?

284
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,639
If you can't accept my ways...

285
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,079
...you can leave at any time.

286
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,279
I've prepared pensions for all of you.

287
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,999
Enough for you to live out your days in comfort.

288
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,919
My Lord.

289
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,839
You must not...

290
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,919
...insult someone who follows you with their life.

291
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,999
If we make mistakes...

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,799
...you can scold or punish us.

293
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,839
But our loyalty to you is always pure.

294
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,079
I have overstepped my bounds.

295
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,639
No matter what, I disobeyed orders.

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,679
I am willing to accept punishment.

297
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,679
To uphold your authority.

A letter

For you

307
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,279
Where did it come from

308
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,959
That day

309
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,199
The one wearing

310
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,439
The man in the black cloak delivered it

311
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,199
Black cloak

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,879
It was him

313
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,180
(Far East
Wasteland Hills)

314
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,439
Lord

315
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,079
What do we do now

316
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,199
We've lost Yalu City too

317
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,999
Those Far East Army men are like madmen

318
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,359
They've chased us for five days and nights

319
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,078
We really can't run anymore

320
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,959
Lord

321
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,439
The Far East Army is catching up

322
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,119
How many

323
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:09,940
One

324
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,999
Just one person

325
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,119
He says he's

326
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,318
King of Light

327
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,078
Lord

328
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,719
Long time no see

329
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,919
You have real courage

330
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,199
This battle

331
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,159
You really made me lose badly

332
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,439
The one who put you in this position

333
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,439
Wasn't me

334
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,519
It was Your Majesty

335
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,959
I wonder, Lord

336
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,439
What do you plan to do next

337
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,199
Next

338
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,519
The Tarta Tribe, second largest of the Demon Race

339
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,319
Has always been the Demon God Emperor's main concern

340
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,999
Even if I withdraw my defenses

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,839
Do you think

342
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,439
He would let you go

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,119
What do you mean

344
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,079
I'm afraid you don't know, Lord

345
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,159
The Demon God Emperor has announced

346
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,719
Support for your nephew, Rod

347
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,359
To continue as Tarta Tribe chief

348
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,759
I heard you and Rod have always been at odds

349
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,959
And now you've suffered a great defeat

350
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,719
Returning home this time

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,999
I'm afraid your future is uncertain

352
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,559
Are you trying to sow discord

353
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,839
Whether it's discord

354
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,879
You'll know once you return, Lord

355
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,959
I came here

356
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,999
First, to see you off

357
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,559
Second

358
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,599
To give you a reminder

359
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,919
Whether you believe it

360
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,839
Is up to you

361
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,999
You really plan to let us go back

362
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,239
Of course

363
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,479
Why

364
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,359
We in the Far East hope

365
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,879
To have a more

366
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,319
Wise and merciful Demon God Emperor to lead us

367
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,279
And personally

368
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,879
I sincerely hope that person

369
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,879
Is you, Lord

370
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,959
If you wish to vie for the throne

371
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,519
We of the Far East

372
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,199
Will be the first to pledge loyalty

373
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,479
Farewell

374
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,319
Your Highness, King of Light

375
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,519
Why did you just now

376
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,839
Say "long time no see"

377
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,439
Have we met before

378
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,559
It was you

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,159
It was me

380
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,620
(One month later
Demon Race Demon God Castle Imperial Garden)

381
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,039
Your Majesty

382
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,319
Ross killed his nephew

383
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,319
And declared war on our Senea Tribe

384
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:53,943
