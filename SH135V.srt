[The Yaochi Grand Gathering, also known as the Peach Banquet, is hosted by the Sacred Land of Yaochi and convened once every five hundred years. Whenever this grand event begins, lords from all directions arrive, and the world’s strongest gather. The young geniuses and proud talents of the Eastern Wasteland all come to attend.]

[Those who participate in the gathering are given the honor of tasting the spiritual peaches from the Yaochi Peach Garden. This Peach Garden is world-renowned—one of the most famous spiritual roots in all the Eastern Wasteland. For mortals, a single bite of the peach’s flesh can extend life, and for cultivators, it offers immense benefits. It is said that the sacred root of the Yaochi Peach Garden was brought forth from the Forbidden Zone of Life — the Divine Ruins (Shenxu), making it one of the most precious treasures beneath the Undying Divine Medicine itself.]

[In addition to the celestial feast, stone-cutting and source art competitions are also major highlights of the Yaochi Grand Gathering. Yaochi possesses countless mystic stones, and the lineage of the Source Celestial Masters once gifted three Stone Kings to Yaochi—one of which originated from the Purple Mountain’s Immortal Egg, said to seal within it the descendant of an Undying Celestial Emperor.]
