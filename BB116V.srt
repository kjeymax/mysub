[Previously]
I'm Li Changshou, a Blue Star native.

33
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,710
With my master Qi Yuan's death,

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,010
I chose to fight the Tao of Heaven
to the end.

35
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,580
[Peng]It was actually Demon Master,
Peng, who showed up.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,810
I joined forces with Yunxiao, Roc,
and Mr. Bai, to besiege him.

37
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,880
Peng used all his might to escape,

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,480
but I blocked him with a trap.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,510
Cornered, Peng began
to belittle the Tao of Heaven.

40
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,810
Roc rebuked him
and struck him down.

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,480
In the cave,
I found Senior Bold's belongings.

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,780
At the same time, I inferred

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
that Peng's death seemed suspicious
in many ways.

FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

45
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,750
Of course,

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,680
this should only be the first step
of the plan on the surface.

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,180
The second step should be related
to the notebook.

48
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,150
Turns out Peng is quite the schemer.

49
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,610
Wait.

50
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,710
Did he show up for you, Master?

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,010
That's right.

52
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,480
He claimed he had waited here
for you for a long time

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,550
and said something strange.

54
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,480
Lord Taibai,

55
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,410
judging from your reaction back then,

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,450
you seemed to know something.

57
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,050
Oh my!

58
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,210
Good heavens!

59
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,750
Please save me.

60
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,110
I was only pretending to slip up
on purpose for Peng,

61
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,810
hoping to coax some useful information
out of him.

62
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,910
Didn't expect it was all nonsense.

63
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,710
How did you get fooled too?

64
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,980
I'm really too dull.
I must study more from you, Master.

65
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,310
I see.

66
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,210
So I misunderstood his words as well.

67
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,480
I managed...

68
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,250
to convince them,

69
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,910
right?

70
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,510
What's wrong?

71
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,980
Did Peng's words unsettle you?

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,650
I'm good.

73
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,180
Master is really awesome.

74
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,880
Lord Taibai and Immortal Yunxiao
are truly fond of each other.

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,280
It's not something you can follow.

76

Oh, right.

78
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,180
When you return to the primordial world,
report this to Martial Uncle Tongtian.

79
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,480
I was planning to do that.

80
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,080
Oh no.

81
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,650

We just got back from the Chaotic Sea,

90
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,010
Could it be another scheme of Peng?

91
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,750
Mr. Bai, don't worry.
I'll use papermen to search at once.

166
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,950
Since the beginning of the world,
I took a nap and woke up here.

167
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,180
This body's cultivation
is ridiculously high.

168
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,750
Pretty good.

169
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,880
The second primordial spirit I cultivated
is finally complete.

170

Entry 2:

171
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,550
The Tao of Heaven
is getting more and more refined.

172
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,550
I can feel the laws and order here
becoming much clearer.

173
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,910
That's good.

174
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,450
Pangu's final wish
might be fulfilled sooner.

175
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,450
Entry 3:

176
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,450
The biodiversity has painstakingly
developed since ancient times,

177
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,180
yet the Witch
are almost eating all beings up.

178
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,480
Hongjun wants
to unite all beings into the Saint

179
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,880
to restrain the Witch.

180
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,710
Calling the Demon

181
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,750
the Saint?

182
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,010
Come on.

183
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,310
Entry 4:

184
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,150
Hongjun's preaching is just the level?

185
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,780
Back in Blue Star,
I could hear all it free of charge.

186
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,280
This philosophy is all garbage.

187
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,350
Entry Five:

188
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,980
The Human are born.

189
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,110
Nyuwa finally became a sage.

190
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,150
She has a bit of my old flair.

191
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,180
But it feels strange

192
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
to watching my ancestor
pinch clay to make people.

193
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,280
Entry 6:

194
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,380
Among the three of the Taoism sects,

195
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,380
Taiqing really has some skill.

196
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,180
He actually deduced the evolution
of the Tao beyond the Tao of Heaven.

197
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,380
Tongtian really needs to be less fiery,

198
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,680
or he will suffer for it later.

199
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,050
The Demon even refines Human spirit souls
into weapons to use against the Witch.

200
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,080
I'll secretly protect a group of Humans

201
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,580
and send them to settle somewhere
in the Three Thousand Worlds.

Entry 373: Took in a good disciple.

203

She should become
the future Immortal Heng'e.

204

The information
in the Bold Notebook is overwhelming.

223
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,950
Senior Bold said "wrong"...

224
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,950
Could he be referring

225
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,250
to the fact
that between the two stories,

226
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,380
one must be a lie?

227
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,450
According to the Taoist Ancestor's
previous account...

228
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,550
He went mad.

229
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,510
He wanted to prove the Tao by force
and destroy the primordial world.

230
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,010
So I had no choice but to kill him.

231
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,610

Hongjun.

233

It's all your fault.

236
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,510
The Taoist Ancestor's story
seems logically airtight on the surface,

237
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,250
but if Senior Bold spoke the truth,

238
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,350
then he must have discovered

239
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,510
the Taoist Ancestor's secret.

240
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,480
Thus, the Taoist Ancestor
joined forces with the Tao of Heaven...

241
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,880
Wait.

242
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,380
The Taoist Ancestor claims
he's bound by the Tao of Heaven.

243
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,110
But the Tao of Heaven is impartial.

244
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,610
How would it kill anyone
for Taoist Ancestor's personal motives?

isn't constrained by the Tao of Heaven,
