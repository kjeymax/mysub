[Tears of Parted Souls, Hatred of Floating Life]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

35
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:43,100
(Jiyang City · Eight Trigrams Formation · Deadly Point)

36
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,940
(General's Mansion)

37
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,460
(In memory of Wang Duo, mourned by his father Wang Lang)

38
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,800
Old friends have gone, returned to their land

39
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,120
Why let new wine recall old sorrow

40
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,200
That year, I entered enemy lines alone, broke their defense

41
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,000
Soon after, my son was born

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,320
Great merit from victory

43
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,680
When he turned one

44
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,800
I placed all things before him

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,440
Yet he loved only this little peachwood sword

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,400
I named him Wang Duo

47
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,200
Hoping one day he'd slay generals and seize banners

48
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Guard the border, reclaim land

49
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,280
When he was five

50
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
It was New Year's Eve

51
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,840
I gave him ten coins as New Year's gift

52
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,840
I thought he'd buy firecrackers

53
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,360
But he gave all the coins he'd saved

54
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,080
To the beggars on the street

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,640
I asked

56
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,880
Duo, my son

57
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
Don't you want to keep some for yourself

58
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
Guess what he said

59
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,040
He said, Dad

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
(In memory of Wang Duo, mourned by his father Wang Lang)
At the end, startled by wind and rain

61
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,320
Poor border, full of snow and frost

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,120
It's Wen Tianxiang

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,360
He blurted out

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,520
It was Wen Tianxiang's poem

65
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,240
At that time

66
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,960
I thought my son would surely become a scholar

67
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,560
How interesting, how amusing

68
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,240
Inside high walls, noble children

69
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,520
Become generals, become scholars

70
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,240
Outside the walls, beggars

71
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,680
At the border, day and night, living on wind and snow

72
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Though I've known Brother Liu for years

73
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,200
I know Old Beggar Liu Wukou seems penniless

74
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
But is worth a thousand gold

75
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,760
Helping us this time

76
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,960
I am deeply grateful

77
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,080
If there's anything Brother Liu fancies here

78
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,320
Just say the word

79
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,720
What could I possibly want

80
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
I have no children

81
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,720
Living in this world

82
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,920
Just a bowl of food, a ladle of drink

83
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,320
I just want to know

84
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,150
How mad this Blade Demon is

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Just how mad

86
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,400
General

87
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,080
Urgent news from the border

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
Enemy troops move out on a snowy night

89
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,360
They're marching south

90
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,620
(In memory of Wang Duo, mourned by his father Wang Lang)

91
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,560
Jiyang City will face a great battle

92
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,480
Prepare yourselves well

93
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,240
The battle the General speaks of

94
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,480
Is not that battle, right

95
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,480
Soldiers just follow orders

96
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,320
Is the General really abandoning the front fort

97
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,240
Stand down

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,000
General

99
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
No battle is ever too late

100
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,560
After this, battles will never end

101
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,680
But for Duo's revenge

102
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
This is the only chance

103
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,000
(In memory of Wang Duo, mourned by his father Wang Lang)

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,080
Is General Wang explaining himself to someone

105
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,360
Just be clear about what you want

106
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,600
All this old beggar wants

107
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,080
Is just a contest

108
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,080
It's New Year's Eve

109
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,660
(The third day)

110
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,280
Someday, I will take the Blade Demon's head

111
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
Danger in Kan, enter Kan

112
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Ominous, time is not right

113
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Drowning

114
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,920
Not good

115
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
One more drumbeat

116
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,640
The underground palace will be flooded

117
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:50,664
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

118
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,200
Hanqing, go back

119
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,920
Who

120
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
No, no, you can't

121
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,630
Grudges can't be ended

122
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,740
Can't be ended

123
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,640
You made a grave mistake back then

124
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,200
Don't make another mistake

125
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,760
I did nothing wrong

126
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,200
I acted out of kindness then

127
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,320
Helped the court escort the Crimson Sand Tribe

128
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
What's wrong with that

129
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
They did the killing

130
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,090
They did the dirty deeds

131
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,960
I am blameless

132
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Your mistake isn't in the past

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,160
But now

134
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,480
A life has been repaid

135
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,200
Grudges are settled

136
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,360
Dust to dust, earth to earth

137
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
Grudges can't be ended

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
A life for a life

139
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,760
If you don't avenge this

140
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,360
How can you live with yourself

141
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,520

Little... Little Blade Demon

He... He's here.

149
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,280
Little Blade Demon

150
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,320
You came at the perfect time.

151
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,120
Quick, tell me where the Blade Demon is.

152
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,880
I can let you die with your body intact.

153
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
You came at the perfect time.

154

Little Blade Demon

155
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,040
Quick, tell me where the Blade Demon is.

Little Blade Demon

157

I can let you die with your body intact.

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
Every second counts.

159
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,600
Go help Brother He.

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
Leave these people to me.

161
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,840
Then be careful.

162
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
Since we're caught in this mess,

163
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,160
we must be ready to face the consequences.

164
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
If you can't bear it,

165
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,480
you'll end up dead and bleeding.

166
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,280
You must always live up to being honorable.

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,240
Of course I'm honorable.

168
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,920
But he killed you.

169
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
You can let go of your own life and death,

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,040
but if I do the same,

171
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,680
that would be dishonorable.

172
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
Hanqing

173
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,280
My life lives on in you.

174
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Only if you live, my death has meaning.

175
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,800
Living...

176
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,080
These past ten-plus years,

177
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,760
I've lived in constant fear,

178
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,160
hiding like a rat everywhere.

179
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,840
Every night, nightmares wake me.

180
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,080
I'm tormented by hatred and regret all the time.

181
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,000
This...

182
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,160
Is this really living?

183
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,360
Coward!

184
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,400
Why aren't you fighting?

185
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
Hurry, get out!

186
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,320
The water's about to flood in!

187
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,000
All your years of hard training

188
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,720
were for this day, to get revenge.

189
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,200
You still don't understand.

190
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,240
Everything today is the fate we deserve.

191
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,840
If you don't let go now,

192
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,760
the burden will only grow heavier.

193
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,160
- Enough, enough!
- Only by living...

194
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,800
Both of you, shut up!

195
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,960
I've had enough.

196
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,880
Blade Demon

197
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,680
The Blade Demon is here!

198
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,800
Isn't that the old man who worked on the boat?

199
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,200
How dare you!

200
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
Open your eyes and look closely.

201
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
I am the Green Snake Sword of the Dinghu Sect.

202
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
(Dinghu Sect, Wang Hanqing)
Wang Hanqing

203
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,440
Dinghu's lone master, Green Snake smiles.

204
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,760
Sword points at the land, chills the world.

205
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,200
They say Dinghu Sect's skills are unfathomable.

206
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,400
But it's been over ten years since any news.

207
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,120
Some say Dinghu Sect is gone.

208
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,760
But the Green Snake Sword remains.

209
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,100
Who dares say Dinghu Sect is gone?

210
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,700
(Green Snake Sword)

211
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,160
Looks like Dinghu Sect's martial arts are impressive.

212
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,640
You actually survived the Blade Demon.

213
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,760
The Blade Demon kills without mercy.

214
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,080
He never lets anyone escape alive.

215
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,040
I'm still alive

216
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,340
only because he thought I was dead.

217
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,260
(Fifteen years ago, Dinghu Sect)

218
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,700
(Dinghu Sect, Wang Hanjiang)

219
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,720
Master! Master!

220
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
You're back already?

221
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,900
(Dinghu Sect disciple, Qi Jin)

222
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,280
So it's Uncle Master.

223
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,160
Where's your master?

224
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,800
Master said the martial world is troubled lately.

225
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,280
He went to find the official from back then to get answers.

226
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,520
Which official?

227
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,800
What kind of leader?

228
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
That's all Master said.

229
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,920
Uncle Master

230
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,640
There's someone over there.

231
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,920
Don't be afraid.

232
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,280
Uncle Master will drive him away.

233
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,560
You're Wang Hanqing.

234
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Who are you?

235
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,760
Jiang Feng of the Crimson Sand Tribe.

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
I've come to take your life.

237
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,400
Jiang Feng

238
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,720
A nobody in the martial world.

239
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,480
Such arrogance.

240
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,460
(A few days later)

241
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,100
(Dinghu Sect, Wang Hanqing)

242
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,360
What are you doing here?

243
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,000
Master

244
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
I've been searching for days,

245
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,800
but I can't find Uncle Master's body.

246
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,640
Those big fish you feed must've eaten him.

247
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
What happened?

248
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,680
A man named Jiang Feng came a few days ago.

249
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,920
He said he wanted revenge on you, Master.

250
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,600
But before he said much,

251
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,320
he split Uncle Master in two with just two strikes.

252
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,240
Jiang Feng has found this place.

253
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,440
Master

254
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,720
Where is your official leader?

255
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,440
Let's find him and avenge Uncle Master together.

256
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
He was a Jinwu Guard back then.

257
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,000
But now, there's no such person in the capital.

258
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Two strikes...

259
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,400
You mean...

260
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Just two strikes

261
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,120
and Jiang Feng killed my brother?

262
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Master

263
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,320
Are you scared now?

264
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
Afraid to avenge Uncle Master?

265
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,190
No.

266
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,960
That's not it.

267
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,400
I can't leave my brother unavenged.

268
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,880
I want...

269
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,280
I need to plan carefully.

270
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,080
Only you know he killed Hanjiang,

271
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,720
not me.

272
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,840
Master

273
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,280
Back then, I acted with you

274
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,520
all to serve the court.

275
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,040
Who knew we'd anger that demon?

276
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,960
But the court abandoned us.

277
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,240
You don't know his whereabouts either.

278
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,680
Pity my brother who died in vain.

279
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,920
You've been hiding for fifteen years.

280
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,400
Has your hatred

281
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,960
ever faded?

282
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,080
It's been years since we met.

283
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,880
Your skills have improved so much.

284
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,400
Now you're deceiving my brother again.

285
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,680
What's your motive?

286
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,480
You know where the Blade Demon is.

287
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,200
In one month,

288
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,480
the Blade Demon's disciple will be trapped in Jiyang City.

289
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,920
Kill him,

290
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,800
and the Blade Demon will surely appear.

291
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,080
Go or not,

292
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
it's your choice.

293
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
Darn it, it should've been me.

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm a wandering, lonely soul.

295
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,800
I've roamed this world for so many years.

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,000
Back then, I just wanted to serve the court.

297
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,240
But it ended up like that.

298
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,640
It wasn't my fault.

299
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
No one ever gave me an answer.

300
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,400
Yet I have to bear all of this.

301
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,920
It's not fair. This isn't fair.

302
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,080
Since I've hidden for so many years,

303
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,000
why can't I let go of grudges?

304
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,280
Why suffer, old and weary, traveling so far?

305
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,640
Coming to this bitter land, just a pawn.

306
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,590
Grudges can't be settled.

307
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,220
Grudges can't be settled.

308
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,750
No, I can't.

309
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,940
No, I can't.

310
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,800
No.

311
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,900
I am Wang Hanqing, the Green Snake Sword.

312
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,640
I, Wang Hanqing, Green Snake Sword,

313
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,160
have always served the court loyally.

314
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,400
Is that wrong?

315
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,720
Is that wrong?

316
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,280
If I can't escape,

317
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,000
then I might as well root out the problem.

318
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,300
Big demon, little demon, none shall remain.

319
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,640
I, Wang Hanqing, am an upright man.

320
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,920
But now, a tiger fallen is mocked by dogs.

321
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,760
Must I take lessons from a youngster like you?

322
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,960
Brother Zhou.

323
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,820
(Soul-Severing Three Ultimates, madness)

324
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,000
Wind-Breaking Saber Technique.

325
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
I've pondered for fifteen years.

326
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,720
Now, it means little to me.

327
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,400
The past was just a dream.

328
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,960
There's no Jiang Feng.

329
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,640
No He Fangzhi, either.

330
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,680
Not even myself.

331
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,400
Tomorrow, when I wake,

332
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,040
nothing will have happened.

333
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,120
Dinghu Sect still stands.

334
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,360
Everything remains.

335
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,480
Hanqing.

336
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,770
Dinghu Sect truly remains.

337
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,880
Dinghu Sect still stands.

338
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,340
Qi Jin, head south.

339
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,510
Go as far as you can.

340
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,440
Don't look back.

341
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,880
Master.

342
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,440
I'm no longer your master.

343
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,610
Go.

344
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,840
It's over. Let's leave.

345
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,510
Brother Zhou.

346
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,290
Brother Zhou.

347
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,840
Why aren't you leaving yet?

348
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,920
When the flood comes,

349
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,160
even wings can't save you.
