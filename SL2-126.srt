(Previous Episode)
Beast God, Di Tian, it's you, huh?

5
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,460
How do you know
I can't arrive in true form?

6
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,060
The situation is terrible.
Many meridians are ruptured.

7
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,990
His vitality is extremely weak.

8
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,090
Wutong, thank you.

9
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,030
You... Don't be so reckless
in the future.

10
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,930
(In this vast world,)

11
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,560
(there is endless
elemental energy to absorb.)

Episode 126
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

13
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,530
(What if I infuse spiritual power
into this solidified soul power?)

14
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,070
This soul power funnel seems to have
developed a strange magnetic field.

15
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,866
And it's already starting
to affect the surrounding space.

16
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,340
In terms of size,

17
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,155
it's almost as big as a small black hole
inside Di Tian's body.

18
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,690
But its purity is much lower.

19
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,420
With my current abilities,

20
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,780
I can't absorb this soul power funnel
into my body.

21
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,720
This highly compressed soul power
could explode at any moment.

22
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,790
For safety's sake, I must
find an open and deserted place.

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,370
(The elemental energy
of heaven and earth within thousands)

24
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:48,222
(of square meters around
is converging here.)

25
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,620
(It's amazing.)

26
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,890
(What kind of law is this exactly?)

27
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,260
(It's out of control!)

28
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,020
(I can't observe it closely anymore.)

29
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:06,711
What's going on? Is it an enemy attack?

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,244
I don't know. The communication team
hasn't reported yet.

31
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,755
(The explosive power is so strong...)

32
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,244
(And this is just
an unfinished product.)

33
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,320
Huo Yuhao!

34
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,560
Where have you been?

35
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,740
I... I went outside
to get some fresh air.

36
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,460
Getting fresh air takes so long?

37
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,150
I... The night is so beautiful tonight.

38
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,440
How did you know I wasn't in the tent?

39
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:56,555
I was passing by and thought
I'd drop in to check on you.

40
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,920
Since you're fine, let's go back
to the academy tomorrow.

41
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
Finally, we can return to Shrek City.

42
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,190
Ladies and gentlemen!

43
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Members of Shrek!

44
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,190
The front line is in a tense situation.

45
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,980
Marshal and Princess Jiu
are both tied up.

46
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,560
But the rewards
Marshal requested from His Majesty,

47
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,320
especially the title
conferred upon Mr. Huo,

48
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,210
are on their way.

49
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,550
Please wait a few more days.
After the conferment,

50
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,111
Marshal will personally
host a banquet to bid you farewell.

51
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,670
I don't need any rewards.

52
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,180
I appreciate the kindness
of White Tiger Duke and His Majesty.

53
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,040
Farewell, everyone. Until we meet again.

54
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,730
Not even the title?

55
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,930
We've been flying for six hours.
Let's take a rest.

56
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,180
Huo Yuhao, I want grilled fish.

57
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,050
(Why does he look so preoccupied?)

58
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,777
The grilled fish is ready.
Everyone can eat now.

59
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,830
I'm not hungry.
I'll eat after cultivating.

60
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,790
Yuhao, you're working so hard.
How can we keep up?

61
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,400
It smells so good.

62
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,220
Nannan.

63
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,940
Do you think today's grilled fish

64
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,350
is different from last time?

65
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,730
It seems like something's missing.

66
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,830
I don't think there's any difference.

67
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,533
It's still as delicious as ever.

68
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,490
I see.

69
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,030
Indeed, something is missing.

70
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,770
But it's not ours.
It's your grilled fish.

71
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:57,288
(Shrek City)

72
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,990
Third Senior Brother, you guys
go back to the Tang Clan first.

73
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm going to the Haishen Pavilion
to consult with Mr. Xuan.

74
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,730
Hello, Ms. Tang. Hello, Senior Huo.

75
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,950
It feels so good to be home.

76
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,650
I'm going to Mr. Xuan's place. Farewell.

77
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,970
(Tang Wutong, why do you
pay so much attention to him?)

78
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,666
(You can't keep doing this.)

79
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,550
Mr. Mu, I'm back.

80
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,410
On this trip,
I actually saw Senior Ye Xishui.

81
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,490
She's now the Death Master
of the Sun-Moon Empire.

82
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,390
Mr. Mu,

83
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,060
can you hear me?

84
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,660
Mr. Mu can't respond to you.

85
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,260
During the beast tide, he
released energy that damaged his soul.

86
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,690
Now he can only recuperate
inside the Golden Tree.

87
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,930
The situation on the continent
has suddenly become so dire.

88
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,920
I never expected
Sun-Moon Empire to be hiding so deeply.

89
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,600
Ye Xishui is indeed still alive...

90
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,400
It's just that she and Long Xiaoyao
have sided with the Sun-Moon Empire...

91
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,090
That's something I didn't anticipate.

92
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,750
Two level 99 Super Masters...

93
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,570
They're enough to shake
the entire continent's situation.

94
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,670
Didn't Senior Du Busi
also break through?

95
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,800
Maybe...

96
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
Du injured his essence during the surprise
attack by the Sun-Moon Empire.

97
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,110
Plus, the younger generation of
Physical Sect has been almost wiped out.

98
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,190
Their morale has plummeted.

99
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,230
It'll be hard for them to compete
with Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui again.

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,390
After this surprise attack,
the Heavenly Soul Empire

101
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,860
has been severely weakened.

102
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm afraid they won't have
the strength to fight again.

103
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,630
Mr. Xuan,

104
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,930
can we gather some hidden sects to fight

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
against the Sun-Moon Empire together?

106
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,600
After all, if the three
original Douluo Continent empires

107
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,920
are invaded by the Sun-Moon Empire,

108
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,740
they won't fare well either.

109
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,030
It's already being done.

110
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,520
Many sects have responded positively.

111
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,210
But in the face of the Sun-Moon
Empire's most advanced weapons,

112
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,490
this resistance force is still too weak.

113
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,020
Mr. Xuan, there's something
I'd like to ask you for advice on.

114
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,560
Previously, when I faced Ye Xishui
in the Mingdou Mountains,

115
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,311
I activated the Reverse Scale
to summon Di Tian to possess me.

116
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,980
Di Tian injected his power into my body
through spatial force,

117
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,990
descending through my body.

118
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:44,709
At that time, I noticed

119
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,290
that Di Tian's soul power operates
entirely differently from mine.

120
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,444
As if it was a series
of interconnected black holes.

121
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,000
It contained an extremely
terrifying amount of spatial force.

122
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,540
The knowledge taught at the academy
only goes up to the Great Soul Master.

123
00:09:57,622 --> 00:10:00,888
It doesn't cover the changes in soul power
after reaching the Grand Soul Master.

124
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,320
Is Di Tian's black hole soul power

125
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,350
unique to Super Master?

126
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,020
Although they're both Super Masters,

127
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,750
Di Tian is clearly
stronger than Ye Xishui.

128
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,140
If Ye Xishui doesn't
use her Tower of Reaper,

129
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,060
she's no match for Di Tian.

130
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,800
I didn't expect

131
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,810
you to reach this level so quickly.

132
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,230
Your judgment is correct.

133
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,830
After a soul master becomes
the Grand Soul Master,

134
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,000
their soul power will transform from its
original liquid state to a solid state.

135
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:31,688
After completing the solid transformation,

136
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,680
a cultivation bottleneck
will be encountered.

137
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,355
For the vast majority of soul masters,

138
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:38,730
this bottleneck
is very difficult to overcome.

139
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,670
Why?

140
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
It's simple.

141
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,290
Solidified soul power cannot flow.

142
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,980
Therefore, after many Grand Soul Masters
solidify their soul power,

143
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,160
their cultivation progress
becomes extremely slow.

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,530
However, solidifying soul power
is the foundation for breaking

145
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,955
through to the Grand Soul Master.

146
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,490
The solidified soul power
will settle in the dantian,

147
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,790
known as the soul core.

148
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,160
The soul core continuously rotates,

149
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,470
absorbing external soul power

150
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,850
for the soul master to use.

151
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,870
So the reason Di Tian is so powerful

152
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,650
is because his soul core can still flow.

153
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,300
Your reasoning is sound.

154
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,350
However, Di Tian's technique
is even more superb.

155
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,950
=The Peerless Tang Clan=

156
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,860
This is the principle
behind Di Tian's soul power situation.

157
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,350
Using his own soul power as a guide,
he causes spatial collapse,

158
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,980
forming a black hole that can
endlessly devour the elemental energy.

159
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,820
Such black hole soul power

160
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,180
requires spiritual power to control.

161
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,320
I can only maintain it temporarily,

162
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,520
while Di Tian can keep it
in a constant state.

163
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,990
This is the gap between me and Di Tian.

164
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,570
Keep it constant?

165
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,800
Wouldn't that mean Di Tian's spiritual
power consumption is extremely huge?

166
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,490
No, he has condensed a second soul core.

167
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,870
The two soul cores complement
each other, forming a stable balance.

168
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,730
The second soul core...

169
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,450
All Super Masters have
condensed a second soul core.

170
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Mr. Mu, Ye Xishui, Long Xiaoyao,
and even Du Busi are all like this.

171
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,360
However, their second soul cores are
all much smaller than their first ones.

172
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,100
Only Di Tian's second soul core
is on par with his first in strength.

173
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,060
So,

174
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,350
he is far more powerful
than ordinary Super Masters.

175
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,600
His strength has already
approached that of a deity infinitely.

176
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,350
A deity?

177
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,350
Yuhao, you have twin martial souls.

178
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,800
It will be much easier for you
to become a Super Master than for us.

179
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:01,311
When you break through
to become a Grand Soul Master,

180
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,120
you must strive to achieve
twin soul cores simultaneously.

181
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:07,622
Your spiritual power far exceeds that
of soul masters of the same level.

182
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,666
It can even rival that
of a Grand Soul Master.

183
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,710
At that time, spiritual power
will be your second soul core.

184
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,120
Mr. Xuan,

185
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,730
what if I achieve a soul core

186
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,470
at my current stage?

187
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,680
Then your cultivation speed
will increase dramatically.

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,760
Because the absorption speed of a soul
core for the elemental energy

189
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,109
is several times
or even dozens of times faster

190
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,550
than that of meditation cultivation.

191
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,360
However, when you reach level 90,

192
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,749
the difficulty of breaking through
to become a Grand Soul Master

193
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,070
will be unprecedentedly high.

194
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,022
Because the first soul core will exert

195
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,960
a huge pulling force on the condensation
of the second soul core.

196
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,010
This is a problem
that even many level 98 Super Masters

197
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,600
face when attempting to break
through to level 99 Super Masters

198
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,530
and feel helpless about.

199
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,720
Mr. Xuan, I want to try.

200
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,970
Alright, I will personally guard you.

201
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,440
Good, keep going.

202
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,390
Let me see how far
you can go in the end.

203
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:35,814
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

204
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,190
(Compress... Compress again...)

205
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,980
(Rotate... Rotate again...)

206
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,400
(The solid soul power has exceeded half
of the total soul power in my body.)

207
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:02,711
(My soul power is draining rapidly.)

208
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,780
(Fifty percent. Sixty percent.
Seventy percent.)

209
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,790
What a strong soul power fluctuation!

210
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,730
Someone is attempting
to become a Super Master.

211
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,830
The core of the soul power fluctuation
is in Mr. Xuan's room.

212
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,160
Since Mr. Xuan is guarding,
there should be no need to worry.

213
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,770
Let's observe here for a while.

214
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,010
That's weird. Who could be attempting
to become a Super Master?

215
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,980
Could it be him?

216
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,990
Eighty percent of the soul power
has been devoured!

217
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,750
Yuhao, hold on.

218
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,250
Your solid soul power
has already been attributed.

219
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,650
If you can successfully
construct a soul core at this level,

220
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,130
you will be able to reach level 89
in a very short time.

221
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,110
Although breaking through to become
a Grand Soul Master will be difficult,

222
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,711
but this is also your opportunity.

223
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,960
Hold on!

224
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,510
Yuhao has reached his limit.

225
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,320
Out of necessity,

226
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,500
I'll use my soul power to confine
his solidified soul power,

227
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,866
and then send it high
into the sky to detonate.

228
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,680
There shouldn't be too much danger.

229
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,960
It's just that Yuhao
will need a few days to recover.

230
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,660
What is that?

231
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,480
Life Reflection Shield!

232
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,750
Skydream!

233
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,730
Keep going. I've got your back.

234
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,120
Skydream!

235
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,840
You're infusing your essence power
into Yuhao's body.

236
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,340
In that case,

237
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,360
if Yuhao fails to ascend to godhood,

238
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,310
when he dies of natural causes,
you'll die too.

239
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,660
When I chose Yuhao,

240
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,266
I had already decided
to share life and death with him.

241
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,260
(Yuhao's soul power and spiritual power
are both nearing their limits.)

242
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,100
(But I can't interrupt him
at this moment.)

243
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,080
(Otherwise,
he'll suffer severe backlash.)

244
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,410
Come on.

245
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,770
Collapse!

246
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,940
(It feels like my soul
is being sucked in.)

247
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,880
(There's endless darkness
in that black hole vortex.)

248
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,100
(Endless unknowns...)

249
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,300
(Yet it's intimately connected to me.)

250
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,470
(Is this my soul core?)

251
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,700
(Huo Yuhao's first soul core is of spiritual
attribute, taking the form of a black hole.)

252
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,980
(The first soul core provides
powerful assistance to Huo Yuhao.)

253
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,590
(Condensing a soul core
is a necessary step)

254
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,290
(for a soul master to ascend
to the Grand Soul Master.)

255
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,450
(Xuan Zi's soul core is
of earth element attribute.)

256
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:40,674
