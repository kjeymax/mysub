1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,666
Today, I'll repay blood
with blood.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,750
A tooth for a tooth.

3
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:24,874
Let you all taste

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,582
what it's like to be prey.

5
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:33,041
No one remains undefeated forever.

6
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:35,042
Come on!

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,207
I'll gather enough for
a perfect tonic soup.

8
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,957
He Wushuang's true blood
is only worth this much?

9
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:54,707
Might as well feed it to pigs.

10
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,082
They're here.

11
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,417
Ancestors,

12
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,582
terrible news!

13
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,916
The first barrier of the Three Thousand Provinces
has fallen.

14
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,082
The sealed city did not appear.

15
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:31,249
The border wasteland

16
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,749
is in grave peril.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,124
My family is still
in the Three Thousand Provinces.

18
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,458
This is bad.

19
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,624
That's the most critical pass
into the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

20
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,041
They must have lured us here on purpose,

21
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,582
preventing us from aiding the border.

22
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,374
If the border falls,

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,041
the Nine Heavens will not hold.

24
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,582
The Ten Realms Diagram

25
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,999
and the Immortal King's burial shroud
are both here.

26
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,041
Failing to reinforce the border immediately

27
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,249
is indeed troubling.

28
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,749
Hahaha!

29
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:56,875
We succeeded!

30
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,749
This is the news
I came here to announce.

31
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:00,917
Elders,

32
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,957
the time has come to cross realms.

33
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:04,707
Time to slay our enemies.

34
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,625
Enough for today.

35
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,124
Next time we meet,

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,874
I'll cut you down myself.

37
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:11,917
You dare stay?

38
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,791
I'll split you in half right now.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,624
Their plan was to lure the tiger
from the mountain.

40
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,374
But we must save the border.

41
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,166
It might be a feint—

42
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,707
forcing us to choose one side to defend,

43
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:25,957
so they can strike the weak point.

44
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,541
This place cannot fall either.

45
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,916
Everyone, take the Ten Realms Diagram
and the Ancestral Dragon Horn.

46
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,457
Rush to reinforce
the Three Thousand Provinces at once.

47
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,583
Great Elder,

48
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:41,875
may I join the battle

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and do my part?

50
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,582
No battlefield is insignificant.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,749
If Great Chitian is breached,

52
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,832
If Great Chitian is breached,

53
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,957
there will be no barrier left behind.

54
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:49,749
You stay.

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,249
You stay.

56
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,874
Guard this line with me.

57
00:02:58,917 --> 00:02:59,917
Great Elder,

58
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:02,207
are we just going to wait here?

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,749
They will return.

60
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,749
How boring.

61
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,166
Even pretending to leave

62
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,832
and ambushing us again

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,832
would be better than this.

64
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,957
Soul Summoning Scripture

65
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,791
Are they trying to revive someone?

66
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:48,874
We welcome the Ancient Ancestor!

67
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,832
Hahaha!

68
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,332
You're too late.

69
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,207
The ritual is complete.

70
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,166
We welcome the return
of Ancient Ancestor Luomo!

71
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:11,499
It's been far too long
since that battle.

72
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,166
This is an Ancient Ancestor
from the Foreign Realm.

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,374
The Foreign Realm has manifested
his remnant soul again.

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,916
They must have some scheme.

75
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,541
Until we see the truth,

76
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,749
none of you act rashly.

77
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,207
The border defense

78
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,417
cannot be compromised.

79
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,832
Lord Luomo,

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,666
we will march straight into this realm.

81
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,457
We need to know how strong
the one who killed you was.

82
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,249
Please enlighten us.

83
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,082
The one who fought me
has long since fallen.

84
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,874
The past is sealed
in this ancient realm.

85
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:45,624
An Lan and Yu Tuo must have calculated
that the seal is weakening today.

86
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,457
Go open it yourselves
and investigate.

87
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,458
Go open it yourselves
and investigate.

88
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,582
We've tried breaking the seal
several times,

89
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,832
but failed each time.

90
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,416
Lord, could you assist us?

91
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,124
It's only a remnant soul—

92
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,916
it could dissipate at any moment.

93
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,957
Summoning me back is useless.

94
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,499
Or perhaps

95
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,624
you have other intentions?

96
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,082
Your descendants have always
been protected by Ancient Ancestor Yu Tuo,

97
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,541
remaining a powerful clan.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,332
If we gain your aid,

99
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,916
our realm will dominate the heavens.

100
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,832
They will be even more revered.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,957
You can rest easy now.

102
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,624
The Key to the Emperor's Path
lies within that realm.

103
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,207
If we obtain it,

104
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,291
our realm will dominate the heavens.

105
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,082
None will dare defy us.

106
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,082
Dominate the heavens—

107
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,249
all for your selfish desires,

108
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,541
using my remnant soul
as a stepping stone.

109
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,124
Hahaha!

110
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,666
Scheming against a dead man.

111
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,832
An Lan, Yu Tuo—

112
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,749
you truly have great skill.

113
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,582
A dead man can still form seals.

114
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,249
A supreme warrior's blood
never fades.

115
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,291
Even in death, obstructed,

116
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,582
it can instinctively unleash its might.

117
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,082
Even if this path leads to certain death,

118
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,999
one day, I will tread it.

119
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:19,123
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

120
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,041
The ancient realm's seal is broken.

121
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,207
What Ancient Ancestor Yu Tuo
sent us to find

122
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,374
may lie deep within this realm.

123
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,541
Could treasures from the Immortal Antiquity
be hidden here?

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,957
The Foreign Realm rattled us
at Great Chitian,

125
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,832
attacking both fronts
to sow confusion.

126
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,207
It wasn't just to lure the tiger away—

127
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,749
it was for this treasure.

128
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,374
This is bad.

129
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:45,792
The Foreign Realm is entering.

130
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,042
They outnumber us.

131
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,125
We only have the Great Elder.

132
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,292
How can we hold them back?

133
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,374
This realm

134
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,374
suppresses us too greatly.

135
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,374
You have lived tens of thousands of years.

136
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,041
Your cultivated Dao is deeply rooted,

137
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,624
clashing violently with this realm.

138
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,249
Before breaking the boundary wall,

139
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,749
you will be repelled.

140
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,166
Bring forth the Immortal Refining Pot.

141
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,750
The opportunity must not be missed.

142
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:22,666
He Ziming,

143
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,249
you juniors take the Immortal Refining Pot

144
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,666
and enter the ancient realm first.

145
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:33,957
Hm.

146
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,541
This blood is quite special.

147
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,457
I should collect some to take back—

148
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,791
it might be useful
to Ancient Ancestor Yu Tuo.

149
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,416
Ah!

150
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,999
Why don't we go in too?

151
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,791
We might snag something good.

152
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,208
Great Elder,

153
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,791
the ancient realm may have laws
that restrain the strong.

154
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,333
Why not take this along—

155
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,583
both offense and defense.

156
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,499
And allow us to accompany you,

157
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,041
just in case.

158
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,832
This blood seems left by an Immortal King.

159
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,916
It can nourish the war banner,

160
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,666
helping it fully transform.

161
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,957
Immortal King blood flows
the moment it's opened.

162
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,166
What kind of existence fell
in this ancient realm back then?

163
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,582
The greater matter comes first.

164
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:18,124
This is a True Phoenix.

165
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,957
This beast can control the blood.

166
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,291
In that case,

167
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,791
refine this blood—

168
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,958
leave not a single drop.

169
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,916
The boundary wall suppresses artifacts too.

170
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,041
Even our supreme Immortal Refining Pot
cannot collect this blood.

171
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:32,666
It's no surprise it harbors killing intent
toward Foreign Realm invaders.

172
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,916
But as a descendant of the Ten Fiends,

173
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,291
how can it not distinguish friend from foe

174
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,332
and attack us as well?

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,916
Must we stop here today?

176
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,999
Hahaha!

177
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,374
Heaven aids us.

178
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,249
It's just like the one
that defected in the Immortal Antiquity era.

179
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,082
A fallen Blood Phoenix.

180
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,624
It's exhausted.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Capture it now!

182
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:11,832
It must have been tainted
before hatching—

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,291
its immortal egg shell stained
by battle blood.

184
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,249
Hence its bloodthirsty nature,

185
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,624
hard to subdue.

186
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,791
The border already faces enemies on two fronts.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,207
We cannot let this realm's power
fall into Foreign Realm hands.

188
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,416
Its mutated bloodline

189
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,582
is somewhat similar to mine.

190
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,791
An immortal must have lived here once,

191
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,207
leaving such rich True Immortal aura.

192
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,999
Sadly, it's not true immortal qi.

193
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,457
If we excavate the treasures in this grave,

194
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,749
it might compensate
for the death of the Ten Kings.

195
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,832
True Immortals here equal the undying.

196
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,291
Even fallen, their might lingers.

197
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,791
Acting rashly could bring dire consequences.

198
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,249
Don't ruin the greater plan.

199
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,999
When our realm's main force arrives,

200
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,999
we can overturn today's losses.

201
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,707
This is an ancient battlefield.

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,624
Someone here struggled
in their final moments,

203
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:47,374
manifesting

204
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,791
their heaven-piercing true form.

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,791
A hand reached into the cosmos,

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,541
plucking down stars.

207
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,749
Under the sweep of immortal Dao laws,

208
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,957
all life was extinguished.

209
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,666
This must be the true blood
left by Ancient Ancestor Luomo.

210
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,832
Its divine power is completely gone.

211
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,916
Could something have devoured it?

212
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,208
Chaos blood...

213
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:18,291
Legend says this blood rivals
seven-colored true blood.

214
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,166
Ancient Ancestor Luomo faced
such a monster back then?

215
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,082
It's not pure enough—

216
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:26,916
only traces of chaos blood.

217
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,791
Otherwise, how could Luomo
have struck it down

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,082
and perished together?

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,541
What's wrong?

220
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,791
I sense the aura
of my clan's blood here.

221
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,707
The rumors were true.

222
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,582
The Guardian's blood—
both divine and demonic.

223
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,874
So your ancestor was the one
who killed Luomo

224
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,958
and guards the treasure here?

225
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,082
Indeed, someone fought Luomo here
in a heaven-shaking battle.

226
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,166
My kinsman was not his match—

227
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,791
he was merely caught

228
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,125
in the aftermath

229
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,542
and fell here.

230
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,374
He did not belong to this place.

231
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,457
He came from the Origin Land.

232
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,833
A Guardian.

233
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,416
If you learned the cruel truth of that year,

234
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,791
you might want to draw your blade
against those behind you.

235
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,791
My clan's bloodline is no tool
for your slander.

236
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,957
Our ancestor did not die
fighting for you.

237
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,749
Right and wrong—

238
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:36,832
I will judge for myself.

239
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,916
A stray dog with no way home

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,582
still dares to speak so boldly.

241
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,332
Pathetic.

242
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,624
The stele inscription is resonating.

243
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,791
Unfortunately, I've been chosen

244
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,249
to take action.

245
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,499
There is no returning now.

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,207
Victory is certain,

247
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,041
yet the path home is severed.

248
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,082
Trapped deep in the game—

249
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,957
how can one know if it's sacrifice
or mere futility?

250
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:14,874
Severing my own immortal path,

251
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,499
clinging to life—

252
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,041
is this the Dao you seek?

253
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,457
Even if I could sever
one finger of the chess player,

254
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,791
what would it achieve?

255
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,166
Calamity approaches.

256
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,124
Who else dares cross the sea?

257
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,249
Perhaps only when the heavens collapse

258
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,832
and samsara ends

259
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,749
can new life emerge.

260
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,082
What exactly happened in the past?

261
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,082
The one who carved the stele
clearly perished with Luomo.

262
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,791
If so,

263
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,166
who is playing the qin?

264
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:08,539
[Spirit Vein Immortal Maiden: The Immortal Maiden of the Spirit Veins was born in ancient times. She once guarded countless primordial spirit veins, holding dominion over the purest essence of heaven and earth. Her form is ethereal and otherworldly, like jade sculpted by divine hands. With every movement, spiritual energy flows like water, nourishing all realms. She is deeply connected to the origin of the world’s spiritual veins, and her presence alone can stabilize lands, mend shattered ley lines, and awaken dormant vitality. Legends say that wherever the Immortal Maiden appears, spirit veins flourish, divine treasures are born, and cultivation prospers. Yet she is rarely seen—appearing only when the balance of heaven and earth is threatened, or when fate itself calls her forth.]
