(Based on "Renegade Immortal" by Lee Geun, Weiwon Group)

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,390
(Previously)
Commander Yo-jang

30
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,070
was seeking someone
with a strong body

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,750
That barbarian fit
the requirements

32
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,350
So I sent him
to the Yo-jang Hall

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,350
He will meet Commander Yo-jang

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,870
and ask for Sibsang

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,670
He must withstand
my White Wolf technique

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,790
to earn the right
to negotiate with me

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,550

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,150
If I win this Yo-jang contest

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,870
I will petition the Yo-je
to appoint you as Commander

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,860
and ask for a city
to be granted to you

Episode 116
[Island of Chaos]
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,990
Among the nine Yo-ryeong armies,

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,030
the Cheonyo Army

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,150
holds a Commander contest
every three hundred years

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,790
The victor

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,070
receives a cultivation technique
and treasure from the Yo-je

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,990
But this contest

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,950
is different from before

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,750
Two hundred years ago

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,150
the Cheonyo and Hwayo armies
went to war

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,470
Both sides suffered
heavy casualties

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,830
We even lost a Commander

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,070
and a Deputy

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,950
The Deputy naturally
took the Commander’s place

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,670
Thus,

58
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,270
the Cheonyo Army now has
two vacant Deputy positions

59
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,870
This time, besides awarding prizes,

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,630
two new Deputies
will be appointed

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,830
All Commanders
are vying for those seats

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,030
Originally, I gathered
eighteen strong men

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,350
to train the Eighteen Demon God Formation

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,790
But you took Sibsang away

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,990
and the technique was broken

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,430
Still, I believe

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,350
if you help me,

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,030
even without the Eighteen Demon Gods,

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,310
I can win the Deputy position

70
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,130
What I promised

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,750
I will do my utmost to help

72
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,750
But I still have
important matters to finish

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,950
In two months

74
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,070
I will meet you again

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,750
Alright

76
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,510
Be sure to keep your promise

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,020
Master Nojo

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,150
Master Nojo has returned

79
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,190
Master Nojo

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,590
Master Nojo has come back

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,790
Master Nojo

82
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,150
Master Nojo has returned

83
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,780
We humbly welcome
Master Nojo’s return

84
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,330
We humbly welcome
Master Nojo’s return

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,170
(The current prosperity)

86
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,230
(reminds me of the Yeonhon tribe’s
former glory)

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,750
Master Nojo

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,750
While you were away,

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,150
all disciples devoted themselves
to training as you ordered

90
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,430
Each day, we released soul essence
into the black mist

91
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,550
and grew stronger

92
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,260
Now, the Soul Energy technique
has shown some results

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,550
Well done

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,150
Sibsang, you have awakened

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,670
Master Nojo, are you alright?

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,270
Thank you for saving my life

97
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,070
I know everything

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,110
Over the past year

99
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,150
you have endured much hardship

100
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,270
Because Master Nojo
did not return...

101
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,750
As long as you are safe,

102
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,630
I do not care if I die

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,270
There is little time left

104
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,190
In two months,
I must go to the Cheonyo Army

105
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,550
Since both of you are here today,

106
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,270
I have an important task for you

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,830
Soul Fusion Arts
have two parts

108
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,830
One is refining the soul

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,830
The other is extracting essence

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,550
Guhyanghwa

111
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,710
You will continue to lead others
and develop new techniques

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,750
You must remember

113
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,670
this technique is only for direct descendants

114
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,510
I will remember

115
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,620
Sibsang

116
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,550
Your cultivation path
is different from others

117
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,310
This is the next stage
of the Beast Horse tribe’s technique

118
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,430
You must further improve your training

119
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,590
Thank you, Master Nojo

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,150
Guhyanghwa, Sibsang

121
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,270
- Yes
- Yes

122
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,670
From today

123
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,830
the Yeonhon tribe will no longer hide

124
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,510
but expand with full strength

125
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,350
When I return next time,

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,750
I hope our tribe exceeds one million people

127
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,630
I accept your command

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,550
I will never betray
Master Nojo’s expectations

129
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,150
(This journey to the Cheonyo Army
is truly perilous)

130
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,950
(The Soul Protection Seal
is not fully restored)

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,950
(but it should still help)

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,310
(The Yeonhon tribe)

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,150
(for now, must be protected
by another soul seal)

134
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,790
Guard the tribe well.

135
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,030
Go on.

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,110
Yes.

137
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,560
Master Nojo.

138
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,090
Hopo...

139
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,150
Maybe already...

140
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,580
He's still alive.

141
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,470
What?

142
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,790
If Hopo had died,

143
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,870
I would have sensed his soul energy.

144
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,470
I scanned Goyoseong with my divine sense before,

145
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,390
but found no trace.

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,750
Even with my cultivation, I couldn't find him.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,670
He must be somewhere truly strange.

148
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,470
That's what it means.

149
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,420
(Magic Tower, Cheonyo Army Ancient Battlefield)

150
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,110
Master.

151
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,070
I've found out.

152
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,190
He has already broken through the Great Circle of Spirit Mutation.

153
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,150
With the commander of Goyoseong,

154
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,230
he's entering the commander duel.

155
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,950
(Sanma)
His cultivation speed is astonishing.

156
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,390
Watch him secretly.

157
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,830
Never let your identity be exposed.

158
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,910
What about the others?

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,790
No breakthrough for now.

160
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,550
But we've been training new warriors lately,

161
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,510
once they gain strength,

162
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,070
they will surely help your return.

163
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,790
Hopo greets Benefactor.

164
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,830
You're doing well lately.

165
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,630
If you refine all the soul essences in the ancient battlefield,

166
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,550
you'll become a capable warrior for Master.

167
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,070
It's all thanks to you, Benefactor.

168
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,590
You saved me,

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,430
taught me your divine arts,

170
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,362
and brought me here to train.

171
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,030
I will always remember this kindness.

172
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,620
(Two months later)

173
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,550
Wangrim.

174
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,390
Speak.

175
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,630
The true use of the Blood Soul Pill—

176
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,110
I'll never tell you.

177
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,030
Just kill me instead.

178
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,150
(Not yet reached the Gate of Enlightenment)

179
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,270
(If forced to use Soul Extraction)

180
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,950
(she could die if it goes wrong.)

181
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,550
If you don't speak,

182
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,230
I could erase you from this world with a forbidden spell.

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
That would be true living hell.

184
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,950
Wangrim.

185
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,590
Someday,

186
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,830
my father will extract your soul

187
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,270
and imprison it in the land of the dead.

188
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,550
You'll know what real hell feels like.

189
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,510
(To rescue Sibsang, with Mak Yehae)

190
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,590
(agreed to enter the commander duel)

191
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,390
(it's also a shortcut to becoming a commander.)

192
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,870
(But the Soul Mark is damaged now,)

193
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,750
(the Blood Soul Pill is useless,)

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,310
(and the Three-style divine power must be used carefully.)

195
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,870
(The only solution is the Slaughter Precept.)

196
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,950
(The slaughter energy refined by the Slaughter Precept)

197
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,030
(harms the body and mind,)

198
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,590
(and is hard to avoid.)

199
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,790
(I've killed many, but)

200
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,350
(I haven't refined much slaughter energy.)

201
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,070
(The slaughter energy I refined before)

202
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,030
(was mostly gained by chance.)

203
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,670
(What is the law behind it?)

204
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,350
Brother Wang.

205
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,550
It's time.

206
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,180
Let's go.

207
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,500
(Cheonyo Fortress)

208
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,060
(Cheonyo Fortress)

209
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,830
Greetings, Commander Mak.

210
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,350
After thirty years,

211
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,110
I've finally returned.

212
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,030
Greetings, Clan Leader.

213
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,470
Everyone, rise.

214
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,230
This is my close friend, Deputy Wang.

215
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,470
From now on, when you see Deputy Wang,

216
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,070
treat him as you would treat me.

217
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,310
Greetings, Wang Deputy.

218
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,310
Brother Wang.

219
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,950
Let's go.

220
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,310
(Capital, Cheonyo Fortress)
Blood Soul Elixir.

221
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,830
It's pretty inside.

222
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,670
Let's check it out.

223
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,990
Blood Soul Elixir for sale!

224
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,700
So many demotions here.

225
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,390
Take care as you go.

226
00:11:54,414 --> 00:12:13,414
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

227
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,190
Isn't that the famous Commander Mak?

228
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,070
Who's with him?

229
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,630
No idea.

230
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,190
But whenever there's a commander duel,

231
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,750
commanders always bring an aide to the match.

232
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,910
If Commander Mak chose him,

233
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,670
he must have special abilities.

234
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,070
He's definitely not ordinary.

235
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,070
Cheonyo Fortress is split into inner and outer rings.

236
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,150
Heaven, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow are the inner ring.

237
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,630
Rain, Universe, Hong, and Yellow are the outer ring.

238
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,710
Civil officials live in the inner ring.

239
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,230
Military officials live in the outer ring.

240
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,350
- I live in the Hong region.
- It fell.

241
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,390
- If you're fine with it,
- Mother.

242
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,710
Stay at our Mak residence.

243
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,590
I'll follow Brother Mak's wishes.

244
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,790
It's been a long time since I came.

245
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,470
The capital is still bustling.

246
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,830
To become deputy this time,

247
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,030
you must be wary of two people.

248
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,670
One is

249
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,710
Mukbi, who guards the Hwayo Army border.

250
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,030
He has many achievements,

251
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,510
and is the strongest among commanders.

252
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,510
The other is

253
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,830
Seokso.

254
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,830
He also guards the border,

255
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,510
and has been my rival for years.

256
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,310
He's skilled in the Six-land Sword Precept,

257
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,070
and his power is unpredictable.

258
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,030
Speak of the tiger and it appears.

259
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,980
(Seokso, Commander, Great Circle of Spirit Mutation)

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,710
Thank you.

261
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,470
Even after guarding the border for a hundred years,

262
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,510
your skills haven't improved at all.

263
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,470
Outsider,

264
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,710
what is your name?

265
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,270
Wangrim.

266
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,630
He's my fellow disciple.

267
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,590
Looks like you'll gain another fortune.

268
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,670
Your cultivation has grown fast.

269
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,910
(Before, Master helped me hide my Gate of Enlightenment training.)

270
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,630
(That's how I could enter here.)

271
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,870
(With that skill,)

272
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,590
(how did you end up seriously injured)

273
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,190
(and even your cultivation fell below the Gate of Enlightenment?)

274
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,070
(Be wary of the Great Sword Sect.)

275
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,430
(My injury too)

276
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,990
was their doing.

277
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,230
That person is called Mak Yehae.

278
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,830
He possesses the Three Divine Styles.

279
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,270
The first style is the Ten Collapse Fist.

280
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,870
The second is the White Wolf of Yohe.

281
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,230
The final style—

282
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,910
was passed down directly by the Yo Emperor.

283
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,840
Its power is overwhelming.

284
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,490
If I hadn't been injured,

285
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,560
I could have killed him.

286
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,100
How is your disciple?

287
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,270
He is very strong.

288
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,830
Even in the mid-stage of Spirit Mutation,

289
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,750
he could stand against the Gate of Enlightenment.

290
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,910
Now that his cultivation has advanced,

291
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,310
it's best not to provoke him carelessly.

292
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,830
Since I met you,

293
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,790
I've never seen you praise someone like that.

294
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,830
But even so,

295
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,870
he's no match for us.

296
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,830
(Makbu, Cheonyo Fortress)
Even after mass slaughter,

297
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,310
you're asking for a place where it won't be a problem?

298
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,600
What are you planning to do?

299
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,590
I've seen this technique before.

300
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,230
What is this, exactly?

301
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,150
It shakes the soul armor,

302
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,590
and stirs the life force within the body.

303
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,750
Does it shake my heart?

304
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,270
Even five strands of gray smoke
can disturb your mind and body.

305
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,630
If you master this technique completely,

306
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,950
you'll command a thousand strands of gray smoke.

307
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,710
Imagine how powerful that would be.

308
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,710
There is a place for slaughter—

309
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,910
there is one such place.

310
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,030
Hongok.

311
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,040
(Hongok, Cheonyo Fortress)

312
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,830
It's one of the four great prisons of the capital.

313
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,430
It holds felons and those sentenced to death.

314
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,270
But the security is strict,

315
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,670
so I can only buy you seven days.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,420
Tonight at midnight,

317
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,350
go to the gate of Hongok.

318
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,950
Someone will guide you.

319
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,470
Clan Leader.

320
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,030
Everything is ready.

321
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,670
Wang Jang should be able to enter Hongok smoothly.

322
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,230
Clan Leader.

323
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,950
Hongok is a strange place.

324
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,370
If Wang Jang goes in there,

325
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,990
won't it be too dangerous?

326
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,870
If he gains fortune,

327
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,750
that is Wang's destiny.

328
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,430
The deputy contest is a grave matter,

329
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,750
so we have no choice but to take risks.

330
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,420
(Hongok)

331
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,470
(Heo Hoecheon, Hongok Warden, Great Circle of Spirit Mutation)
Are you the one Mak Yehae mentioned?

332
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,560
