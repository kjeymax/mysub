FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,500
(Ancient Secret Treasury Entrance)

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,020
(You Quan Dynasty, You Qing, Second Nirvana Realm)

40
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,060
(Hong Huang Dynasty, Hong Lie, Second Nirvana Realm)

41
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,540
(Mo Yan Dynasty, Shi Kun, Second Nirvana Realm)

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,750
Gentlemen,

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,910
Greetings.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,350
Brother Shi Kun,

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,430
I heard your Mo Yan Dynasty has run into some trouble lately.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,670
Just a minor issue.

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,510
Thank you for your concern, Brother Hong Lie.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,310
Spending a million Nirvana Pills to hunt a kid from a lesser dynasty—

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,670
That’s more than just a minor issue, isn’t it?

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,910
You jest, Brother Hong Lie.

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,710
A million Nirvana Pills is nothing to Mo Yan Dynasty.

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,430
But I heard

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,910
you suffered heavy losses fighting Wu Ji Dynasty for the Ancient Secret Key.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,630
If you need, I can lend you some Nirvana Pills, worthy brother.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,910
The Ancient Secret Treasury is full of dangers.

56
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,680
If your strength falls short,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,830
you may enter alive

58
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,240
but not leave alive.

59
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,550
You worry too much, Brother Shi Kun.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,750
Our Hong Huang Dynasty has powerful allies.

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,190
Gentlemen,

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,990
The fourth key holder still hasn’t appeared.

63
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,750
If he doesn’t show up,

64
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,030
aren’t we all wasting our efforts?

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,070
With Brother Shi Kun’s methods,

66
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,110
that kid from the lesser dynasty probably won’t make it.

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,670
I wonder which dynasty will catch that fat sheep.

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,070
Someone’s finally here.

69
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,660
Someone’s arrived.

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,910
Gentlemen,

71
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,870
Which dynasty are you from?

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,950
Da Yan Dynasty.

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,420
(Da Yan Dynasty, Lin Yan, Lin Dong, First Nirvana Realm)
Lin Dong.

74
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,670
Lin Dong.

75
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,790
(That’s Lin Dong.)

76
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,300
What?

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,020
Lin Dong?

78
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,710
Isn’t he the one Mo Yan Dynasty is hunting?

79
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,030
He’s the fourth Ancient Secret Key holder.

80
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,670
That kid actually survived.

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,390
Sorry

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,540
to keep you all waiting.

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,350
Ran into a few minor troubles on the way.

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,830
Brother Shi Kun,

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,710
Looks like you won’t be spending that million Nirvana Pills.

86
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,990
Now that all four key holders are here,

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,150
let’s open the treasury.

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,630
Wait.

89
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,110
Lin Dong,

90
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,270
You killed my brother Shi Xuan.

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,750
Today, you’ll pay for it.

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,990
Treasure is won by strength.

93
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,390
Shi Xuan failed to take my Ancient Secret Key.

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,350
He simply wasn’t strong enough.

95
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,350
You seem quite confident in your strength.

96
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,270
That guy—

97
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,590
Has he reached the peak of Second Nirvana Realm?

98
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,430
Second Nirvana Realm, huh?

99
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,390
Die!

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,710
(This kid…)

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,750
Essence Energy!

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,350
Get lost!

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,750
First Nirvana Realm.

104
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,870
Celestial Rune Master.

105
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,670
Big brother!

106
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,270
Don’t worry, Xiao Yan.

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,590
He can’t do anything to me.

108
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,950
Second Nirvana Realm.

109
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,670
Doesn’t seem so impressive.

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,830
Arrogant!

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,550
Purple Shadow Nine Breaks!

112
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,430
Petty trick.

113
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,710
Back off!

114
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,990
Didn’t expect

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,390
that kid Lin Dong is actually something.

116
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,070
Golden Demon Heaven Blade!

117
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,550
Slash!

118
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,390
Great Wasteland Heaven Imprisoning Finger!

119
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,930
Five Fingers Move Heaven and Earth!

120
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,830
Break!

121
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,870
Gentlemen,

122
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,150
We struggled to find the Ancient Secret Key

123
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,990
not to watch you settle personal grudges.

124
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,310
Please, that’s enough.

125
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,150
Let’s open the treasury first.

126
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,870
Sister You Qing is right.

127
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,840
We’re all here for

128
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,240
the treasures and martial arts in the Ancient Secret Treasury.

129
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,390
Wasting time here benefits no one.

130
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,590
How about you both take a step back?

131
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,550
Lin Dong,

132
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,550
Our feud isn’t over.

133
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,350
Don’t think you’ll leave the Ancient Secret Treasury alive.

134
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,750
Anytime.

135
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,880
Let’s begin.

136
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,550
Please, everyone, present your Ancient Secret Key.

137
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,860
This…

138
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,270
This…

139
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,070
This is truly spectacular.

140
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:55,394
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

141
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,270
A treasury of this scale—

142
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,550
must hold countless treasures.

143
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,870
Everyone,

144
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,590
If we meet while searching for treasure,

145
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,830
Hong Huang Dynasty will show no mercy.

146
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,990
Let’s go.

147
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,270
Yes.

148
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,150
Why does that guy’s aura feel so familiar?

149
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,320
Go.

150
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

151
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,190
Senior Brother

152
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,070
What should we do?

153
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,630
Finding the treasure comes first.

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,910
We'll deal with that kid later.

155
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,110
Let's go.

156
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,950
Yes.

157
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,400
We should head out too.

158
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,430
This Ancient Secret Treasury
is truly massive.

159
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,270
Xiao Diao

160
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,390
Any ideas?

161
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,430
A sect this size must have
all kinds of rare pills.

162
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,110
Let's go to the Elixir Chamber first.

163
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,680
But where is the Elixir Chamber?

164
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,870
Just follow Master Marten.

165
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,670
Let's move.

166
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,390
Xiao Yan

167
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,070
Kid

168
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,790
Look!

169
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,030
Is that the sect's Elixir Chamber?

170
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,150
Master Marten smelled the strong
scent of pills from far away.

171
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,190
Let's hurry.

172
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,980
(Elixir Storage Pavilion)

173
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,660
(Elixir Storage Pavilion)

174
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,550
Those guys move fast.

175
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,550
They worked hard to get
the Ancient Secret Key.

176
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,030
Of course, they want to profit here.

177
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,510
Big Brother

178
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,390
What should we do?

179
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,510
We go in, of course.

180
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,590
Alright.

181
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,670
Get lost!

182
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,150
All the pills here belong
to Hong Huang Dynasty.

183
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,310
Kid

184
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,150
Stop!

185
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,670
Big Brother

186
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,510
Aren't we taking those Nirvana Pills?

187
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,590
The rare pills must be deeper
in the chamber.

188
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,350
No need to fight them here.

189
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,950
Got it.

190
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,670
Kid

191
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,110
You finally get it.

192
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,110
After seeing the Pill River,

193
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,510
these Nirvana Pills
aren't much anymore.

194
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,910
Looks like broadening your horizons
helped.

195
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,430
Yan Sen

196
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,430
The pills here—

197
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,870
You won't take a single one.

198
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,030
Beat me first, then we'll talk.

199
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,590
The fighting here is even fiercer.

200
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,550
That is—

201
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,550
a pill furnace.

202
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,150
Let Master Marten take a look.

203
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,070
What's wrong?

204
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Xiao Diao

205
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,870
That's—

206
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,840
the Life-Death Cycle Pill.

207
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,620
Life-Death Cycle Pill.

208
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,710
Is that a rare pill?

209
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,150
If a cultivator gets
the Life-Death Cycle Pill,

210
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,150
even if their meridians are broken,

211
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,350
and their Origin Dan shattered,

212
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,990
they can recover completely with it.

213
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,950
That's amazing.

214
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,430
If Master Marten gets it,

215
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,150
he can restore his physical body.

216
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,750
If that's the case,

217
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,350
let's seize the Life-Death Cycle Pill.

218
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,710
Don't worry.

219
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,270
Xiao Diao

220
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,500
Leave the Life-Death Cycle Pill
to me and Xiao Yan.

221
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,260
Second Brother

222
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,040
Your problem is my problem.

223
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,540
You guys—

Wait!

229
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,230
What?
