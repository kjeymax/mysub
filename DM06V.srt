Come forth!

2
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,520
I'm too weak to use my power now.

3
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,680
My power...

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,440
You're injured.

5
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,040
The intelligence is wrong.

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,990
The Nightraven could not be sealed.

7
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,590
Ms. Liu, I'll get you out of here.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,980
Ding Xiao, see you outside.

9
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,440
Ding Xiao!

10
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,040
Monkey?

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,080
Ding Xiao, you're finally here.

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,840
Elder Lin,

13
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,980
the Nightraven broke the seal!

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,940
What?!

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,980
Miao Xun.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,440
What exactly happened?

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,040
Director Ling.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,040
For some reason, the Nightraven shattered the Heavenly Chains.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,040
Facing the monarch-level evil spirit, we lost a lot of disciples.

20
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,540
Where's Ding Xiao?

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,240
He's still in the tower.

22
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,180
My power-recording talisman failed,

23
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,040
so he sent me out using his own talisman.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,640
Monkey,

25
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,440
take care of Ling for me.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,480
Without the power-recording talisman, you'll be trapped...

27
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,910
What did you say?

28
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,810
Form up!

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,410
Seal off the Spirit Suppression Tower!

30
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,210
Hold on!

31
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,210
One of my disciples is still in the tower.

32
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,910
You know exactly what's happening now.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,650
Facing a monarch-level evil spirit,

34
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,550
a level-6 spirit disciple can never survive.

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,150
Elder Lin.

36
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,550
Please allow me to enter the tower.

When will you teach me the Flaming Sword?

thanks for helping me get rid of the evil spirit,

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,010
or I can never see Xi again.

127

You're Bai Xi's mother?

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,680
So you are...

129
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,780

130

You're really my mother!

134

It's been 15 years.

135
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,180
I've been looking for you all along.

136
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,610
Why would you end up here?

137
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,810
Xi.

138
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,680
You must have gone through a lot.

139
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,780
Mother...

140
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,280
What exactly happened?

141
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,310
What exactly happened?

142
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,880
Xi.

143
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,580
The evil power has eroded most of my memories.

144
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,880
Now I only know that I was asked to eliminate evil spirits in Luofeng City.

145
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
To save my teammate Xue Qing,

146
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,580
I had a fierce fight with the evil spirits.

147
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,980
That's all I can remember now.

148
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,210
Father refused to tell me anything.

149
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,610
He even forbade me from looking for you.

150
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,180
Even so, I still believed you were alive.

151
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,580
Young man,

152
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,510
when you helped me get rid of the evil spirit, I sensed an evil power in your Spirit Space.

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,280
Ma'am, do you know what it is?

154
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,280
I do.

155
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,580
15 years ago,

156
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,480
I saw the same power in Luofeng City.

157
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,910
So,

158
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,880
you and Ling are really the survivors of Luofeng City.

159
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,210
Your strange power comes from this evil power.

160
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,910
My sister suffers a lot from this strange power.

161
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,080
Ma'am, is there a way to get rid of it?

162
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,110
I've lost all my power, so there is nothing I can do.

163
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,510
However, Xue Qing might make a difference.

164
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,410
He's an expert in healing arts.

165
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,280
Maybe he can help you.

166
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,680
Ma'am?

167
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,610
Mother!

168
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,180
Mother!

169
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,210
Mother!

170
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,440
Mother!

171
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,510
Within 15 minutes,

172
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,380
if a soul can't be guided to the afterlife,

173
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,980
it'll disappear for good.

174
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,030
Mother!

175
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,180
Xi.

176
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,180
I wasn't there when you grew up.

177
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,480
Do you hate me?

178
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,010
No, I only miss you day and night.

179
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,010
Xi.

180
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm so happy to know that you've been missing me

181
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,180
all these years.

182
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,680
How I wish I could watch you grow up.

183
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,510
If there's a next life,

184
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,380
I hope I can make it up to you.

185
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,380
Mother.

186
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,810
Didn't you say you wanted to see my spirit beast?

187
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,610
Sure.

188
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,680
Good or evil,

189
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,580
it's all decided by the host's will.

190
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,180
Seven-colored Sacred Bird!

191
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,780
Come forth!

192
00:13:45,804 --> 00:14:02,704
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

193
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,980
Ma'am,

194
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,280
it's time.

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,780
Wait.

196
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,880
Let me do this.

197
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,480
Miss Bai.

198
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,680
To guide a soul to the afterlife, disciples of the Guibu Division must recite the Soul-guiding Mantra.

199
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,410
I'll use my power to help you activate the soul-calming talisman.

200
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,610
The living are but travelers,

201
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,810
going to the same destination.

202
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,680
Heaven or hell,

203
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,410
we're all pathetic.

204
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,180
Mother!

205
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,580
Mother!

206
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,480
[A few days later]

207
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,210
The Evil Spirits Termination Contest is really full of challenges.

208
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,710
Without you guys, I could never get the pill.

209
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,580
Thank you so much.

210
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,380
Xiao, you're too kind.

211
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,180
It's because of your help that we can be promoted to the Sect's branch in Longlin County.

212
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,840
Exactly!

213
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,780
Ling is your sister.

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,510
Helping her is actually no biggie.

215
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,010
The four of us will have to report to the branch in Longlin County tomorrow.

216
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,110
We're here to say goodbye to you.

217
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,010
Bottoms up!

218
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,210
From now on, we're like family.

219
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,480
Exactly!

220
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,610
We're family!

221
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,440
Bottoms up!

222
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,810
The Golden Spirit Pill may suppress the strange power in Ling's body for now,

223
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,480
but it can't wipe it out for good.

224
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,580
Ding Xiao.

225
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,610
There are many talents in the Ghost Market.

226
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,210
Yeah!

227
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,680
Ghost Market!

228
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,610
Perhaps, we can find something useful there.

229
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,510
I did hear about it before.

230
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,410
There are only a few people

231
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,010
who know where it is.

232
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,410
I know its location.

233
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,280
Bai Xi?

234
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,210
Xun, let's go check on Ling.

235
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,910
Yeah, yeah!

236
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,840
We'll go check on Ling.

237
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,310
Let's go.

238
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,340
I can walk by myself.

239
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,910
I just wanna see what happens next.

240
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,010
The Ghost Market is where all kinds of information flow.

241
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,680
It is said that there's a legendary doctor there.

242
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,410
His witchcraft is totally worth a try.

243
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,510
Maybe we can even get Xue Qing's whereabouts.

244
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,580
Let's go.

245
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,540
Okay.

246
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,430
[Preview] What exactly [Preview] happened in Luofeng City back then?

247
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,850
[Preview] I have a hunch that [Preview]

248
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,010
[Preview]
the truth is close.

249
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,250
[Preview]

250
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,260
[Preview] What I want is [Preview]

251
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,110
[Preview]
something you can't give.

252
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,910
[Preview]

253
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,830
[Preview] Even if you want my life, [Preview]

254
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,840
[Preview]
I'd still give it to you.

255
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,430
[Preview]

256
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,270
[Preview]
Ding Xiao.

257
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,620
[Preview]

258
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,160
[Preview]
My master ordered me to bring you back.

259
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,500
[Preview]

260
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,980
[Preview]
I don't care who you are.

261
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,720
[Preview]
None of you is getting out of here alive today.

262
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,500
[Preview]

263
