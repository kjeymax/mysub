(Tang Wutong, why do you)

22
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,410
(pay so much attention to him?)

23
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,490
(You can't keep doing this.)

24
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,770
The solidified soul power
will settle in the dantian,

25
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,110
known as the soul core.

26
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,050
Mr. Xuan, I want to try.

27
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,690
Alright, I will personally guard you.

28
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,830
Keep going. I've got your back.

29
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,870
Come on.

30
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,070

Episode 127
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

32
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,190
(Yuhao is going to fuse the first
soul core into the Spiritual Sea,)

33
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,340
(not the dantian?)

34
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,800
(Good.)

35
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,000
(In this way, the second soul core
will have a place to reside.)

36
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,720
Yuhao, you've succeeded!

37
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,820
You've really condensed your first
soul core at the Soul Saint stage!

38
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,130
Comprehend it well.

39
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,860
This kind of realization
is an opportunity that many soul masters

40
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,600
never get in their entire lives.

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,380
Mr. Xuan, it wasn't you who was attempting
to form the second soul core...

42
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,520
It was...

43
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,020
This kid, Yuhao.

44
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,660
He might be the first person
in 10,000 years on the Douluo Continent.

45
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,680
A real devil among devils.

46
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,420
Now it's time for these young people
to step onto the stage of history.

47
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,530
Notify all members
of the Haishen Pavilion

48
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,750
to assist Tang Clan
in forming Soul-Guiding Master Corps.

49
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:06,780
(One Month Later)

50
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,210
(He is ascending.)

51
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,820
(What's going on? My soul power
is circulating on its own!)

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,180
Dong'er.

53
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,860
Sorry, I'm Tang Wutong.

54
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,180
It's me who should apologize.

55
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,430
Mr. Xuan asked me to tell you to go
to the Tang Clan when you wake up.

56
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,550
(Tang Clan)

57
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,240
Okay, lower it down.

58
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,430
Senior Brother Bei,
the third batch of materials

59
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,950
sent by the academy has arrived.

60
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,810
Move that box over there.

61
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,060
Okay, quickly send it to the warehouse.
This place is almost full.

62
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,000
First Senior Brother!

63
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,990
Yuhao, you're finally back.

64
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,110
You've been meditating
in the Haishen Pavilion for a month.

65
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,220
We've been so busy.

66
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,240
Senior Brothers, what's going on here?

67
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,240
Did the academy send a lot of materials?

68
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,050
More than that.

69
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,800
Come, let's talk while we walk.

70
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,640
Soul-Guiding Master Corps?

71
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,740
After discussions in Haishen Pavilion
and considering various opinions,

72
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,400
the academy has decided to establish
three Soul-Guiding Master Corps.

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,280
Three?

74
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,650
(Just like the Sun-Moon Empire.)

75
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,240
(If one Soul-Guiding Master Corp
has 500 members,)

76
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,190
(equipping three Corps
would mean 1,500 people.)

77
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,300
(It's not easy to produce
equipment for 1,500 people.)

78
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,660
The first Soul-Guiding
Master Corp is named

79
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,460
Tang Clan Soul-Guiding Master Corp.

80
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,990
It's specially approved by the academy

81
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:43,330
and has the best equipment
among the three.

82
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,350
It has a total of 200 members,
all equipped

83
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,860
with the most advanced soul tools
from the Tang Clan.

84
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,530
It's composed of soul masters
above the soul emperor level.

85
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,640
The leader is Dean Xian Lin'er,

86
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,060
and the deputy leader
is Dean Qian Duoduo.

87
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,888
At the same time,
Tang Clan Soul-Guiding Master Corp

88
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,730
will have a total
of 10 Grand Soul Masters.

89
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,630
All will be supplemented by the academy.

90
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,330
There are 200 people, among whom 10
are Grand Soul Masters.

91
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,190
Even the most powerful national
defense force of the Sun-Moon Empire,

92
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,430
the Royal Soul-Guiding Master Corps,
doesn't have such an exaggerated setup.

93
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,000
Can our Tang Clan meet such
a high demand for soul-guiding tools?

94
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,360
That's why this corp is entirely composed
of close-combat soul-guiding masters.

95
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,720
All the tools equipped are mainly
for enhancing speed and attack power.

96
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,170
The only linked soul tool
is for group defense.

97
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,350
I see. This way, it can indeed
play to its strengths

98
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:32,755
and make up for its weaknesses.

99
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,022
Then, about the other two
Soul-Guiding Master Corps...

100
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,600
I suppose they are mainly equipped

101
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,660
with long-range tools
and fixed-installation tools.

102
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,160
You're quick, Yuhao.
You got it right away.

103
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,569
About the other two Corps,

104
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,930
one is called the Heavy Artillery
Soul-Guiding Master Corp.

105
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:48,060
It is equipped with 300 of Tang Clan's
most advanced Zhuge Crossbow Cannons.

106
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,488
The last one is called the Fortress
Soul-Guiding Master Corp.

107
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,120
It has 1,500 soul masters.

108
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,650
It is equipped with one type of tool,
the Terrain Self-propelled Fortress.

109
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,710
There are 300 of them.

110
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,540
These three Soul-Guiding Master Corps
are like three money-devouring beasts.

111
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,530
Nannan, you're starting to sound
like Mr. Qian Duoduo.

112
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,830
Let's not mention
the huge financial cost for now.

113
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,510
To meet the tools of these
three Soul-Guiding Master Corps,

114
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:15,890
I'm afraid our Tang Clan's
rare metals won't be enough.

115
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,190
Although we took away a batch
of rare metals from the Sun-Moon Empire,

116
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,830
we still lack rare metals
of the highest grade.

117
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,740
Yes, that's why
we urgently called you back.

118
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,560
Got an idea?

119
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,810
Mm-hmm.

120
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,320
Qiuqiu.

121
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,700
Huo Yuhao.

122
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,810
Come with me.

123
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,679
(Shrek City, Sunset Forest, Dragon City)
Our Earth Dragon Clan is located

124
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,511
in the north
of the Heavenly Soul Empire,

125
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:44,600
near the Arctic Land.

126
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,660
There is a hidden ore vein
in our sect's secret realm.

127
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,960
It's highly likely that a rare type
of rare metal is buried there.

128
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,600
Possible? Hasn't Earth Dragon Clan
detected it themselves?

129
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:59,270
The temperature in the secret realm is
extremely low and it's very dangerous.

130
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,460
Even a Great Soul Master like my mom
can't go deep inside.

131
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,830
Only a soul master with the ultimate ice
like you can possibly enter.

132
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,220
Since our Earth Dragon Clan
has chosen to join the Tang Clan,

133
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,010
this ore vein naturally
belongs to the Tang Clan.

134
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,580
Moreover...

135
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,710
Moreover?

136
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,933
Dragon City,
where Earth Dragon Clan is located,

137
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,930
has been conquered
by the Sun-Moon Empire.

138
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,177
If the resources within the clan
are not transferred out,

139
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:25,133
they will inevitably be seized
by the Sun-Moon Empire sooner or later.

140
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,177
We're almost there.

141
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,900
Dragon City, the foundation
of Earth Dragon Clan.

142
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,711
My mom is in a crucial moment
of closed-door cultivation in Shrek City,

143
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,700
so I'm the one bringing you here.

144
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,680
=The Peerless Tang Clan=

145
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,230
Follow me.

146
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,380
(Purple Demon Eye!)

147
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,140
There are guards. What should we do?

148
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,190
I've thought of a way to enter the city.

149
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,355
Firefly's Glow.

150
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
(Data Detection System,
Mingdou Mountains, signal normal)

151
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,360
(Warning)

152
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,750
The Navigator has lost contact!

153
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,990
It's okay. New models always
have various minor issues.

154
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,580
It's shift change time.
Where are those two?

155
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,480
Probably gone AWOL. It's so cold.
I don't want to patrol either.

156
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,040
This outfit is so warm.

157
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,810
(Dragon City)

158
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,680
(This Dragon City doesn't
seem to have fallen at all.)

159
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,850
(As a border city near the Arctic Land,
it's quite popular instead.)

160
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,730
(When the Sun-Moon Empire
invaded in force,)

161
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:05,059
(the entire Celestial Dragon Clan
rose up to resist)

162
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,711
(and assisted the city defense forces
in holding Dragon City.)

163
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,180
(The sect leader, Celestial Dragon Master,
even died a heroic death.)

164
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,569
(Unfortunately, at that time,
our Earth Dragon Sect)

165
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,911
(had already fully
relocated to Shrek City.)

166
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,160
(We couldn't lend them a hand in time.)

167
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,110
(Celestial Dragon Clan...)

168
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,470
(Where's Yu Tianlong?)

169
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,530
(He went missing after the great battle.
I hope he's still alive.)

170
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,310
(This is the City Lord's Mansion.)

171
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,711
(Those are people from
the Sun-Moon Chamber of Commerce.)

172
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,400
(After Dragon City fell,)

173
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,560
(the first batch to enter
the city were these merchants)

174
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,930
(They brought many cold-resistant supplies
and advanced thermal energy devices,)

175
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:55,270
(which they distributed
at low prices or even for free.)

176
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,600
I'll follow them in and take a look.

177
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,250
Hey,

178
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,140
what about me?

179
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,666
You stay here as a backup.

180
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,430
Give everything to them.
Don't feel bad about it.

181
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,820
The marshal said,

182
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,010
once they get used to living with tools,
they won't be able to live without us.

183
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,500
In a few years, we'll win over the hearts
of the entire city's populace.

184
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,070
(Technological infiltration
is indeed a good strategy.)

185
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,330
(Who exactly is
this mysterious marshal?)

186
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,420
Speaking objectively,

187
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,600
such measures
to improve people's livelihoods

188
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,500
have indeed helped
many civilians in the city.

189
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,800
You're actually siding with them?

190
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,810
(Thermal Energy Device,
Free Distribution Point)

191
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,180
This is a tactic used by many invaders
throughout history.

192
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,920
Kill the resistors
and silence the opposing voices.

193
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,410
Then buy people's hearts with benefits.
Soon, they'll only hear one voice.

194
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,360
Support.

195
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,266
But in the end, it's just to satisfy

196
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:12,260
the invaders' ambition
of long-term colonization.

197
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,080
As the battle lines stretch,
the people in these colonies

198
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,540
will only become the nourishment
for the war machine.

199
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,080
You seem to know a lot.

200
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,819
The exact same thing happened
on the Douluo Continent

201
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,488
ten thousand years ago.

202
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,810
(Earth Dragon)

203
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,950
Yuhao!

204
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,890
Little girl, I've been waiting for you.

205
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,270
Mountain Python Sect, it's really you.

206
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,888
Sect Leader, capture the young master
of the Earth Dragon Sect

207
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,240
and present her to the Sun-Moon.

208
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,260
Then our sect can secure the position
of the top sect in Dragon City.

209
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,140
So, on the day Dragon City fell,

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,000
when the Celestial Dragon Clan
was fighting a bloody battle,

211
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,950
your sect defected
to the Sun-Moon Empire!

212
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,860
Cut the crap. After capturing you,

213
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,370
Nan Shuishui will surely surrender
with her whole sect.

214
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,010
Huo Yuhao, where have you been?

215
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,870
Breath of the Giant Python!

216
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:17,329
Huo Yuhao, why aren't you
coming out to help?

217
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,720
You can do it. Pull yourself together
and follow my commands.

218
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,000
Aim for the python's vital spot!

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,377
An attack from the Kan position.
Retreat to the Li position.

220
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,430
Throw a punch from Kun position.
There's a flaw in the enemy's Xun position.

221
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,311
Throw a palm strike!

222
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,060
Throw a palm strike with your left hand
and gather strength with your right.

223
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,930
Hand of Obliteration.

224
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,550
Fifth Soul Skill,
Rouge Annihilation Sword!

225
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,460
Target the Qian position.

226
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,270
A killing blow in one strike!

227
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,260
You traitorous scum!

228
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:14,510
You should have died long ago.

229
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,710
Huo Yuhao,
you actually stood by and watched!

230
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,070
Making me deal
with these three stinky pythons alone.

231
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,260
Come in.

232
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,870
Let's go.

233
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,950
(Dragon City, originally the northern fortress
of Heavenly Soul Empire, adjacent to Arctic Land,)

234
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,650
(has abundant mineral resources. It was later
occupied by Sun-Moon Empire.)

235
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,980
(The Earth Dragon Sect, an ancient sect located in Dragon City,)

236
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,480
(inherits the Rouge Dragon
with the power of obliteration.)

237
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,280
(The Sect Leader is Nan Shuishui,
an 82 offensive-type Great Soul Master.)

238
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,080
(The Mountain Python Sect, a local sect
of Earth Dragon Sect, marked by poisonous pythons,)

239
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,880
(has long been in the shadows of
Celestial Dragon Clan and the Earth Dragon Sect.)

240
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,840
With the sound of the cannon,

241
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,900
the Source of Destruction
makes its grand entrance.

242
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,600
I heard you want to join
the Extreme Solo Soldier Plan?

243
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,740

247
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,100
Even the training secrets
of Shrek Academy are within your reach.

248
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,070
Scan the code quickly!

249
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,870
I'll be waiting for you on WeChat!

250
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,020
(Since the commencement
of Soul Land 2 on 8 Aug 2021,)

251
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,050
(it's been 1567 days since Episode 127 is broadcasted.)

your continuous support and love.)

256
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,640
(The new generation of Shrek Seven Devils
will carry on the mission.)

(There seems to be something
underwater drawing me in.)

283
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,280
(This place is indeed a treasure trove.)

284
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,190
The temperature ahead...

285
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,080
I estimate it's nearly absolute zero.

286
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,310
The ice here

287
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,820
seems capable of freezing even souls.

288
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
You must be careful!

289
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,019
I must absorb at least half of this

290
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,266
Ten-Thousand-Year
Mystic Ice Essence first.
