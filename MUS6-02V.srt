(Previously on)
The Ancient Secret Treasury is full of danger

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,550
If your strength is lacking

39
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,190
You may enter alive

40
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,850
But not leave alive

41
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,030
Sorry

42
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,400
Sorry to keep you all waiting

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,750
(That's Lin Dong)

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,430
Lin Dong

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,590
You killed my brother Shi Xuan

46
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,070
Today you must pay the price for it

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,310
Treasure is won by strength alone

48
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,910
He just wasn't strong enough

49
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,590
You two

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,510
Please, that's enough

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,630
Let's open the treasury first

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,710
A treasury of this scale

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,950
Must hold countless treasures

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,550
A sect of this size

55
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,460
Must have all kinds of rare pills

56
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,680
Let's head to the Elixir Chamber first

57
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,480
Kid

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,140
Look quickly

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,830
That's

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,990
The Life-Death Cycle Pill

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,630
Stop him

62
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,980
Episode 2
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,670
Kid

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,110
Prepare to die

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,720
Kid

66
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,790
What gives you the right to snatch it

67
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,150
Ever heard of "first come, first served"?

68
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,550
Who cares about "first come, first served"?

69
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,600
Treasure goes to the capable

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,310
Darn kid

71
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,470
Yan Sen

72
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,310
Don't even think about it

73
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,300
Kid

74
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,130
Stop chasing

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,110
But

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,110
Don't worry

77
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,270
They won't get the Life-Death Cycle Pill

78
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,110
Jerk

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,470
Life-Death Cycle Pill

80
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,010
I'll be taking it

81
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,150
This...

82
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,310
What's going on

83
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,100
What

84
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,430
What's that

85
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,470
Master Marten sensed it earlier

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,030
That pill furnace is covered in Death Force

87
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,830
Death Force

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,310
Good thing you warned me earlier

89
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,790
Senior Brother Yan Sen

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,220
Quick

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,590
Heal me

92
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,180
Yes

93
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,950
Everyone

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,670
Disperse that black mist

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,550
Yes

96
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,270
Those fools

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,350
Do they really think they can disperse Death Force?

98
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:38,950
Kid

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,270
If we can restart the pill furnace

100
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,430
Maybe

101
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,270
We can remove the Death Force

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,070
Start the pill furnace

103
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,940
Xiao Yan

104
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,510
Come with me

105
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,270
There's some Spiritual Power left here

106
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,620
It should be the mechanism to start the furnace

107
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,270
Elder Brother

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,030
This thing

109
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,950
Can it still be used?

110
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,270
Hit it with all you've got

111
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,610
Yes

112
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,190
Why panic

113
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,000
Give it to me

114
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,870
It's done

115
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,660
Hurry

116
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,310
Lin Dong

117
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,150
That kid

118
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,430
Stop him

119
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,240
Yes

120
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,550
Exploding Wolf Split

121
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,380
Get lost

122
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,590
The Life-Death Cycle Pill is mine

123
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,150
None of you will get the Life-Death Cycle Pill

124
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,870
Jerk

125
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,230
Elder Brother

126
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,030
He really has a death wish

127
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,830
That kid is crazy

128
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,310
This...

129
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,750
How is that possible

130
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,070
That's

131
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,150
The Life-Death Cycle Pill

132
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,990
Take the pill from his hand

133
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,790
Yes

134
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,660
Leave the Life-Death Cycle Pill

135
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,070
Devouring Thunder Palm

136
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,380
(Devouring Thunder Palm)

137
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,670
How...

138
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,950
What's happening

139
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,230
This is...

140
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,590
What power is this

141
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,030
Xiao Yan

142
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,620
Let's go

143
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,840
Okay

144
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,150
Elder Brother

145
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,590
Lin Dong

146
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,270
I will never let you go

147
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,950
Can't believe that kid got away

148
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,630
Elder brother,

149
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,270
Are you all right?

150
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,630
I'm fine.

151
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,330
Just inside the formation,

152
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,490
I suffered some internal injuries.

153
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,560
Kid,

154
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,790
Were you trying to get yourself killed just now?

155
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,130
That was the spiritual fire for pill refining.

156
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,000
If not for the Stone Talisman protecting you,

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,390
you...

158
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,560
I promised you

159
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,480
I'd help you recover your physical body.

160
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,380
At least you have some conscience.

161
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,740
What's wrong?

162
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:32,990
Forget it.

163
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,590
Now's not the time.

164
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,750
Master Marten needs to refine a physical body.

165
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,390
It'll take at least several months.

166
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,270
Searching for martial arts and treasures in the Ancient Secret Treasury

167
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,800
means every second counts.

168
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,340
Let's talk about it after we get out.

169
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,450
Xiao Diao,

170
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,870
you...

171
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,350
Stop wasting Master Marten's time.

172
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,660
Your injuries aren't serious, right?

173
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,990
These minor wounds

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,710
are nothing to worry about.

175
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,310
If that's the case,

176
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,150
let's move on to the next place.

177
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,710
Where is this place?

178
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,350
Xiao Diao,

179
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,140
(Tian Gang Alliance)

180
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,870
Tian Gang Alliance.

181
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,790
One hundred and eight sects,

182
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,230
sixteen Guardian Sects,

183
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,870
and four Grand Sects.

184
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,430
Tian Gang Alliance.

185
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,190
Looks like the Ancient Secret Treasury

186
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,150
is the ruins of the Tian Gang Alliance.

187
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,030
So many sects gathered here.

188
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,830
No wonder it's so vast.

189
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,750
This must be one of the Alliance's sects.

190
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,990
Not sure which sect, though.

191
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,230
Let's go in and take a look.

192
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,350
Maybe

193
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,870
there are martial arts manuals inside.

194
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,510
We'd better be careful.

195
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,400
The Alliance's ruins

196
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,670
won't be that simple.

197
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:43,940
Let's go.

198
00:15:43,964 --> 00:16:18,164
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

199
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,430
Kid,

200
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,470
did you notice?

201
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,470
Since we entered the ruins,

202
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,250
it feels like someone's been watching us.

203
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,230
Elder brother,

204
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,270
the entrance...

205
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,310
is gone.

206
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,590
This place

207
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,180
is really strange.

208
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,550
Let's check it out.

209
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,470
Get out of my way!

210
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,870
Don't kill me!

211
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,070
Help me!

212
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,190
Those spirit entities are...

213
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,510
Xiao Yan!

214
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,340
(You Quan Dynasty, Mu Sha, Celestial Rune Master)

215
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,350
Wind-Thunder Seal!

216
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,820
Thunder!

217
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,940
(Wind-Thunder Seal)

218
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,750
Senior Brother Mu Sha,

219
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
check on them.

220
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,950
Yes.

221
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,300
Darn it!

222
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,580
I am Mu Sha of the You Quan Dynasty.

223
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,100
(He's also a Celestial Rune Master.)

224
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,100
Da Yan Dynasty.

225
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,090
Lin Dong.

226
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Brother Lin Dong,

227
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,060
I suppose you came here seeking treasure too?

228
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,400
Of course.

229
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,140
Looks like our luck

230
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,170
isn't so great.

231
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,980
This whole ruin

232
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,170
is guarded by a powerful formation.

233
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,660
Forget treasure—

234
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,920
it's hard enough just to get out alive.

235
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,720
Since it's a formation,

236
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,020
if we find the formation core,

237
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,190
we can break it.

238
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,810
It's not that simple.

239
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,680
This ruin

240
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,040
keeps changing.

241
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,950
No matter where we go,

242
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,330
we end up back here.

243
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,820
We've been exploring here for a while.

244
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,060
You see the result.

245
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,420
I'll investigate myself.

246
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,300
Maybe

247
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,220
I'll find something else.

248
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,940
Farewell.

249
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,380
Brother Lin Dong,

250
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,860
I have a suggestion.

251
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
Your strength is impressive.

252
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,980
I truly admire it.

253
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,900
Why don't we

254
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,610
work together to break this formation?

255
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,240
Work together?

256
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,260
That's right.

257
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,260
If we break the formation,

258
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,820
and get the treasure inside,

259
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,910
we split it fifty-fifty.

260
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,340
That benefits us both.

261
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,940
I appreciate your offer,

262
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,200
but I'll have to decline.

263
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,490
However,

264
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,500
my brother and I

265
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,900
never work with outsiders.

266
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,340
Besides, treasure hunting is about skill.

267
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,980
There's no such thing as splitting.

268
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,180
If that's the case,

269
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,490
then I

270
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,980
won't force you, Brother Lin Dong.

271
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,020
Let's go.

272
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,620
Xiao Yan,

273
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,820
Senior Brother Mu Sha,

274
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,820
What now?

275
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,020
Ungrateful fool!

276
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,340
You'll pay for this.
