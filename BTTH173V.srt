EPISODE 173
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,190
(A One-Star Saint of Battle Qi, Xiao Yan, emerges)

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,540
(With his own Buddha's Wrathful Samsara)

29
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,750
(He incinerates all Half-Saint foes at once)

30
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,660
(Nether River Alliance's defeat)

31
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,580
(Spreads quickly across Central Plains)

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,500
(Xiao Yan leads troops to pursue the victory)

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,700
(He wipes out the Nether River Alliance)

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,780
(The fall of Nether River Alliance)

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,420
(Starfall Pavilion rises among
Wind and Thunder Pavilion, Sky Nether Sect, Ice River Hall)

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,950
(Wind and Thunder Pavilion, Sky Nether Sect)
(The Central Plains are in turmoil again)

37
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,970
(Ice River Hall)
(Meanwhile)

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,660
(Three alliance letters from Starfall Pavilion)

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,780
(Are quietly sent to three top powers)

40
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,460
(Xiao Yan knows only alliance)

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,860
(Alchemist Tower, Burning Flame Valley, Starfall Pavilion)
(Only together can they face Soul Hall)

42
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,500
(These three powers' choices)

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,580
(Flower Sect)
(Will decide if the alliance succeeds)

44
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,510
Starfall Pavilion, in just two years

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,500
Produced a Saint of Battle Qi

46
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,380
Is this your so-called countermeasure?

47
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,980
Hall Master

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,860
Things have come to this

49
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Why get angry over a discarded pawn?

50
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,420
You have an idea

51
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
Xiao Yan must have obtained the Bodhi Core

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,860
That's how he became a Saint of Battle Qi

53
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,660
But his foundation is unstable

54
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,260
We can make him stop here

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,390
(Soul Hall Vice Hall Master, Three-Star Saint)
Make an example

56
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,260
It's not just Starfall Pavilion that can do this

57
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,820
Alliance

58
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,500
Still has to fight Soul Hall

59
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,820
Those freaks from Soul Hall are disgusting

60
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,300
But who wants to mess with them?

61
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,940
(Ancestor Huo Yun, One-Star Saint)
Let Starfall Pavilion's people leave

62
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,530
Ancestor

63
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,580
Soul Hall is watching us closely

64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,180
I'm afraid one day

65
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,900
Father, please stop for now

66
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,620
Ancestor, calm down

67
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,580
Take care of your health

68
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,780
Be careful your hidden ailment worsens

69
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,290
Huo'er is the sensible one

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,790
Xiao Yan from Starfall Pavilion

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,300
Is a One-Star Saint of Battle Qi

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,780
Yes

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,500
And has ties with us

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,660
So young

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,060
How does he look?

76
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,430
If he's decent-looking

77
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,540
And willing to marry Huo'er

78
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,890
I'll agree

79
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,870
Ancestor, you...

80
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,620
You're not acting your age

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,910
Huo'er, don't be rude

82
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,460
To reach One-Star Saint at his age

83
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,500
Shows how outstanding he is

84
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,840
And you both like him

85
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,790
This young man is extraordinary

86
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,050
Ancestor

87
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,060
They said

88
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,600
If we join the alliance

89
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,260
They can cure your hidden ailment

90
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,980
What if we refuse?

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,450
If we refuse

92
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,780
I will personally help

93
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,660
To cure your internal problem

94
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,040
Young friend Xiao Yan

95
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,890
You're here

96
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,230
Ancestor

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
This is Xiao Yan from Starfall Pavilion

98
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,940
I am Xiao Yan

99
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,270
Greetings, Ancestor Huo Yun

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,020
You're not bad, kid

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,460
Without this

102
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,010
The alliance

103
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,850
Is off the table

104
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,540
Ancestor

105
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,620
What do you mean?

106
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,180
Let's form the alliance

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,260
I've been away for years

108
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,340
I wonder if anyone

109
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,980
Still remembers the name Ancestor Huo Yun

110
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,260
On behalf of Starfall Pavilion

111
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,910
I welcome Burning Flame Valley to the alliance

112
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,060
Good

113
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,660
See you at Starfall Pavilion

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,740
Soul Hall may attack again anytime

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,810
We must quickly repair the Sect-Protecting Array

116
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,390
Yes, Sect Leader

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,350
Teacher, are you alright?

118
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm fine

119
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,780
Go check on the other sisters

120
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,580
Senior Sister

121
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,150
The urgent task

122
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,020
Everyone, go heal your injuries quickly

123
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,980
Yes

124
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,300
Medicine Elder

125
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,700
Sect Leader Yun

126
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,670
What happened?

127
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,980
Flower Sect's Sect-Protecting Array failed

128
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,490
Flower Sect was ambushed by Soul Hall

129
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,080
Luckily, the Grand Elder emerged in time

130
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,350
And repelled them

131
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,060
Slightly injured

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
But nothing serious

133
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,890
You all should recover quickly too

134
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,060
Thank you, Medicine Elder

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,120
No need to thank me

136
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,660
If Starfall Pavilion hadn't pushed for alliance

137
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,300
Soul Hall wouldn't have targeted us

138
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,700
That voice is...

139
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,540
(Immortal Qing, Half-Saint)

140
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,700
Greetings, Grand Elder

141
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,780
Immortal Qing

142
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,660
Yao Chen

143
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,950
He actually survived

144
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,660
Made such a mess

145
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,620
Hurry and clean up, send the guests off

146
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,660
Don't let others laugh at us

147
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,410
- Yes
- Yes

148
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,220
Medicine Elder, we still have aftermath to handle

149
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,350
Sorry for the poor hospitality

150
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,240
It's fine

151
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,800
After all these years,

152
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,940
your temper hasn't changed a bit.

153
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,970
Medicine Elder,

154
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,100
who is Starfall Pavilion allying with?

155
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,260
That's none of my business.

156
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,060
But if Flower Sect gets involved,

157
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,420
don't blame me for being harsh with you.

158
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,820
Sorry.

159
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,620
Flower Sect suffered because of Starfall Pavilion.

160
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,580
But that was never our intention.

161
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,260
What's done is done.

162
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,700
Please, you should leave now.

163
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,260
I don't want Flower Sect to be destroyed.

164
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,060
Soul Hall failed this time,

165
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,420
but they'll surely attack again.

166
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,580
The Spirit Clan vanished mysteriously.

167
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,780
There must be a bigger plot behind Soul Hall.

168
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,540
You know the forces backing Soul Hall.

169
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,820
If I agree to join forces with you,

170
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,700
and something happens to Flower Sect,

171
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,180
I can't bear that responsibility.

172
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,140
Soul Hall is ruthless and cruel.

173
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,290
Their actions are unpredictable.

174
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,460
If Flower Sect joins the alliance,

175
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,180
the alliance will do everything

176
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,860
to protect every member.

177
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,620
Three days from now,

178
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,900
if I come,

179
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,020
it means Flower Sect agrees to ally.

180
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
If I don't show up,

181
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,020
then all of this

182
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,860
never happened.

183
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,700
I hope you'll come.

184
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,060
Burning Flame Valley has agreed to ally.

185
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,500
Now we just await replies from Flower Sect and Alchemist Tower.

186
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,900
Don't expect too much from Flower Sect.

187
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,060
Soul Hall's attack this time

188
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,780
has left them disheartened.

189
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,620
So now,

190
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,980
Alchemist Tower

191
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,380
is our key focus.

192
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
That's right.

193
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,980
Alchemist Tower hates Soul Hall deeply,

194
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,060
but they've always stayed neutral.

195
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
It's not easy to deal with.

196
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,220
Should we send another letter to test them?

197
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,660
We can't be hasty with this.

198
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,380
To persuade them,

199
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,660
Xiao Yan and I must go in person.

200
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,460
We'll look after things at Starfall Pavilion.

201
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,700
Everything's been settled for now.

202
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,380
There shouldn't be any trouble.

203
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,140
Brother Chen,

204
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,780
when do you plan to leave?

205
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,100
No time to waste.

206
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,460
We'll leave today.

207
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,460
It's been years since I came here.

208
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,220
Alchemist Tower is still so vibrant.

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,260
But thinking of the Inner Dan Ta Elder Court,

210
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,820
those stubborn old men,

211
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,740
it's hard to describe.

212
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
Inner Dan Ta—

213
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,860
Most people only know Alchemist Tower,

214
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,100
but Inner Dan Ta is its true core.

215
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,190
Alchemist Tower is different from Flower Sect

216
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,220
and Burning Flame Valley.

217
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,460
Alliance decisions depend on elder votes.

218
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,260
Since its founding,

219
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,860
Alchemist Tower has never meddled in others' affairs.

220
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,580
Even if the three giants help us win votes,

221
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,660
we must be ready to fail.

222
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,500
Soul Hall dominates Central Plains.

223
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,500
Their power far surpasses ours.

224
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,700
Only by bringing Alchemist Tower into the alliance

225
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,580
can we unite everyone against them.

226
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,780
No matter how hard it is,

227
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,460
I must give it a try.

228
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,700
Well said.

229
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,180
Old Medicine Elder,

230
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,260
you've been recovered for a while now.

231
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,220
Why only now did you come back to visit?

232
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,070
You know as well as I do,

233
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,420
the Elder Council doesn't like me.

234
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
You seem to have recovered well.

235
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,620
You've even reached Half-Saint.

236
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,340
A blessing in disguise.

237
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,280
Long time no see.

238
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,860
I'm only here because I need something.

239
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,100
How's the alliance going?

240
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,750
After receiving your letter,

241
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,100
I proposed the alliance to the Elder Court.

242
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,300
But those stubborn elders are hard to convince.

243
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,920
After much effort, I got four votes.

244
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,060
Including your three, that's only four.

245
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,800
That's not enough.

246
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,260
We need a majority of the eight seats.

247
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,460
Only then will it pass.

248
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,240
The Alchemist Tower Ancestor is absent now.

249
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,880
It's really tough.

250
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,860
The Ancestor is wandering the world again.

251
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,950
He's been missing for years.

252
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,070
If not for his soul jade slip being intact,

253
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,940
we'd think something happened to him.

254
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,420
Three days from now,

255
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,060
the Elder Council will induct a new elder.

256
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,220
The new elder will have a vote then.

257
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,400
Elder Xuan,

258
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,820
who is the candidate for new elder?

259
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,060
Has the candidate been decided?

260
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,580
The strongest contender now

261
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,780
is Old Eccentric Hou.

262
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,180
But he's always been at odds with you.

263
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,580
If he gets elected,

264
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,220
he'll surely obstruct the alliance.

265
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,860
Old Eccentric Hou—

266
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,460
that old guy

267
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,060
has disliked Medicine Elder since the Dan Meeting.

268
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,620
He's never liked Medicine Elder.

269
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,660
You beat him at the Dan Meeting with the Soul Ascension Technique.

270
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,220
He's always doubted your methods.

271
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,020
He holds a grudge against you.

272
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,900
Elder Xuan,

273
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,620
can my teacher run for election?

274
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,180
Medicine Elder left Inner Dan Ta voluntarily.

275
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,460
He can't rejoin the Elder Court.

276
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,540
Old Medicine Elder isn't eligible.

277
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,060
But Xiao Yan is.

278
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:29,184
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

279
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,020
After you left,

280
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,150
Xuan Yi kept worrying about you.

281
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,780
Xuan Kongzi,

282
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,010
No one thinks you're mute if you stay quiet.

283
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,040
Xiao Yan is the Dan Meeting champion,

284
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,690
and a candidate for Alchemist Tower leader.

285
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,670
He's eligible to run.

286
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,130
That's actually a good idea.

287
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,700
But Old Eccentric Hou can summon Nine-Colored Pill Lightning now.

288
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,110
Are you confident?

289
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,940
It's worth a try.

290
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,590
Remember to re-certify your alchemist badge.

291
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,060
So no one questions you.

292
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,390
No time to waste.

293
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,970
I'll go prepare with Xiao Yan first.

294
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,470
The three of us should return to Inner Dan Ta to prepare for the contest.

295
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,170
Sorry to trouble you, seniors.

296
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,940
Eighth-grade Alchemist

297
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,620
Not bad, almost as good as I was.

298
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,490
Senior Hou

299
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,920
Something feels off about this pill.

300
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,140
Could you take a look for me?

301
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,820
(Old Eccentric Hou, Eighth-grade Alchemy Master)

302
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,860
You clearly didn't follow the scroll.

303
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,080
Did you sneak in extra ingredients again?

304
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,190
I've told you before,

305
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,820
stop always trying to innovate.

306
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,220
Stick to the rules.

307
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,020
Senior, please check my pill.

308
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,140
Who's this brat?

309
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,980
You startled me.

310
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,460
This pill is quite good.

311
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,540
Fragrant and evenly colored.

312
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,380
Technique...

313
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,580
is off.

314
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,940
You mixed in other ingredients.

315
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,160
That's against the rules.

316
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,260
Teacher.

317
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,380
Yao Chen.

318
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,140
Why are you here?

319
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,300
So you're Yao Chen's disciple.

320
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,340
No wonder.

321
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,980
You old geezer, still alive after all.

322
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,420
You actually escaped Soul Hall.

323
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,500
Lucky to be alive.

324
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,260
How could I go before you?

325
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,540
Teacher, this is Senior Hou.

326
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,830
That's just how he is.

327
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,480
Just call him Old Hou.

328
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,540
You left the Inner Dan Ta on your own.

329
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,540
I thought you'd never return out of pride.

330
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,940
Alchemist Tower nurtured me.

331
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,460
It's only right to come back and visit.

332
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,900
I see.

333
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,700
You must be after the Inner Dan Ta elder seat.

334
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,660
That's why you shamelessly came back.

335
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,660
I wasn't interested in the elder seat.

336
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,300
But since you're competing,

337
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,260
I have to show you my skills.

338
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,700
Let you see my current strength.

339
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,100
See you in the arena.

340
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,350
(I'm the one competing.)

341
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,540
He doubted me back then,

342
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,940
but he's not a bad person.

343
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,180
Just got caught up in winning and losing.

344
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,130
His dedication to alchemy

345
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,580
is no less than mine.

346
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,860
Such a strong herbal scent.

347
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,380
Didn't expect this hidden place in Alchemist Tower.

348
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,580
That's because...

349
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,260
Inner Dan Ta is the elite force here.

350
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,260
Greetings, Elder.

351
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Two intermediate eighth-grade alchemists.

352
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,540
One advanced eighth-grade alchemist.

353
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,060
This one's aura is unfathomable.

354
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,180
(Great Elder Lin, Two-star Saint of Battle Qi)
That's Great Elder Lin of Inner Dan Ta.

355
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,140
Except for the Ancestor,

356
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,180
he's the most senior in Inner Dan Ta.

357
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,040
Even I must show respect to him.

358
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,750
Elder selection.

359
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,180
We've all been through this before.

360
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,940
The rules

361
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,300
need no further explanation.

362
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,100
All herbs here are free for contestants.

363
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,370
Whoever refines the best pill

364
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,700
- Highest grade wins.
- Yao Chen.

365
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,320
- That person is the winner.
- I'll challenge you this time.

366
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,100
If there are no questions,

367
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,860
contestants, please enter.

368
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,020
Yao Chen, step down.

369
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,300
Teacher, wait for my good news.

370
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,180
Yao Chen's disciple.

371
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,120
Who is this young man?

372
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,140
So young,

373
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,000
yet already an eighth-grade alchemist.

374
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,050
Xiao Yan is Yao Chen's disciple.

375
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,140
He's also this year's pill competition champion.

376
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,700
He has eighth-grade alchemist skills.

377
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,300
By the rules,

378
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,340
he's qualified for the elder selection.

379
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,890
Brat.

380
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,940
This isn't an ordinary contest.

381
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,540
Let me show you my skills today.

382
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,260
See what true alchemy is.

383
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,460
(Such powerful soul waves.)

384
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,100
(Don't worry, Teacher.)

385
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,860
(Xiao Yan won't shame your name.)

386
