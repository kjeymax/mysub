Xi He absorbed the Sacred Tree's power,

reached Primal Origin Phase

31

32

My soul was unstable.

33

I couldn't fight her off.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,160
Though I retreated at once,

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,640
she still got me pretty good.

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,600
Her power

37

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,560
The Life-Pillar Sigil is hidden here.

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,640
It's said that the blood
of Lumina Goddess can break the seal.

your condition is still unstable.

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,800

Finally,

65
