1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,879
[Previously]
All forces hunt and kill...

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,599
a sword-bearing man named A Liang.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,199
Dare leak the news...

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,999
shatter your golden body!

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,559
Kill Chen Ping'an...

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,519
gain a life of fortune!

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,679
If not for Bao Ping...

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
you'd be dead.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,479
Sheathe your sword.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,520
Sheathe your sword.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,479
Don't waste the sword's vital essence.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
This...

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,399
is sword qi!

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,399
Sword, come!

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
A Liang...

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
I've decided.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,559
Reading's useless...

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
so annoying.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,639
Qi Jingchun wants to roam Jianghu with you!

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Live free, avenge wrongs...

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
drink the strongest wine...

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
wield the fastest sword!

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,599
Stop patting my head...

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
I'll never grow tall!

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,199
A Liang...

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,719
yes or no?

27
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
Give me a straight answer!

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,999
I've saved the money...

29
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
dozens of silver taels!

30
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Scram, scram!

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,679
Still a kid...

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,759
spouting big words.

33
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,799
Little Qi...

34
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,199
Master...

35
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,559
why twist my ear?

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,039
Who beat you this badly?

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,039
That Zuo fellow...

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
Him?

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,399
So heavy-handed...

40
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,239
Lost the argument
and flew into rage?

41
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,599
Second Senior admitted defeat...

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,159
but said no matter how much I read...

43
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,479
I'd never surpass you, Master.

44
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,039
Nonsense!

45
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,439
Your knowledge is vast...

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,719
but you're old.

47
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
but you're old.

48
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,839
I'm young...

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,359
I'm young...

50
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,159
One day I'll surpass you!

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,239
He wouldn't listen...

52
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,759
said prove it...

53
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,959
surpass you tomorrow.

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,039
Infuriated me...

55
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,839
snuck a punch when off guard.

56
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,319
Lost in the end...

57
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,839
Gentlemen use words,
not fists!

58
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,879
Gentle...

59
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,239
men sit straight...

60
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,719
stand proper...

61
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,199
stand proper...

62
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,559
Etiquette adapts...

63
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,839
customs follow suit.

64
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,199
Little Qi...

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,799
You'll grow up one day...

66
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
become steady.

67
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Just wonder...

68
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,359
by then...

69
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
your disciples...

70
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,319
or favored children...

71
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,399
will still have your resilience...

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,559
that fire in your bones...

73
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,039
for swift justice.

74
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,119
Father...

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,439
Spare him today...

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,279
and I'll die for you to see!

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,959
Chen Ping'an...

78
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
You know...

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,399
I've always admired you.

80
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,399
But...

81
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,439
sorry.

82
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
It's fine.

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,239
We choose our own paths.

84
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,519
This...

85
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
this is...

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
sword qi!

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
No!

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,519
Sword, come!

89
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Sword, come!

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Stop, stop!

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,199
Wasting heaven's gift!

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,119
A loving family...

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,559
why fight and kill?

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
why fight and kill?

95
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
You and your father...

96
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,119
return my hero's gall...

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,999
and purple qi book...

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
plus those Li family talismans.

99
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
But these...

100
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,919
can only save one.

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,999
Zhu Lu...

102
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,119
you choose.

103
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,399
Please, Senior A Liang...

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
let Zhu Lu go.

105
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,959
I'll atone with my life.

106
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,159
No need to soil your blade.

107
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
I said...

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,759
Zhu Lu...

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
must die.

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,079
I beg you...

111
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
spare her!

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,719
What child hasn't caused trouble...

113
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,479
acted recklessly?

114
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,039
Lu'er is just naive...

115
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,639
forgive her, please!

116
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I beg you...

117
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,359
please!

118
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,719
Chen Ping'an...

119
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Lu'er...

120
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,119
is only a child.

121
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,159
Fine.

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,319
Some punishments
are crueler than death.

123
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Leave.

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,959
I never want to see you again.

125
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
A Liang...

126
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
got any wine?

127
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,799
Plenty of wine...

128
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,319
but listen...

129
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,279
never drink when heartbroken...

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,759
turns you into a drunkard.

131
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,239
Drink when joyful...

132
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
and maybe...

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
become a wine immortal.

134
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
You help others...

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,679
Hello, Lin Shouyi.

136
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,519
We've met before.

137
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,399
My true identity...

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,879
is Grand Elder
of Dali's Changchun Palace...

139
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,439
an immortal in mortal eyes.

140
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I trust you...

141
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,679
so I want to try...

142
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,159
convincing you...

143
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,199
to cultivate Dao arts
at Changchun Palace with me.

144
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,199
Father said a master
would guide me to the capital...

145
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,519
and if I died obscurely outside...

146
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
he wouldn't collect my corpse...

147
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,719
a dead man...

148
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,239
isn't worth the travel.

149
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,799
Harsh words...

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,359
but true.

151
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Lin Shouyi...

152
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,799
step forward...

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,079
and you'll walk the Bridge of Immortality.

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,999
Thank you for the offer...

155
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,519
but I waited here...

156
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,959
to decline in person.

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,839
Birth sect and name...

158
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,919
weren't my choice.

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
But my path...

160
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,919
I choose myself.

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,879
Pity... such fine cultivation jade.

162
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,999
Lin Shouyi...

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Lin Shouyi!

164
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Trouble!

165
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,799
Ghosts!

166
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,559
Chen Ping'an...

167
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,439
Along this journey...

168
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,319
from Qidun Mountain
to the bamboo grove...

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,359
I've tested you many times.

170
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Now...

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
one last time.

172
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,879
A Liang...

173
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,799
you're leaving?

174
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,839
Back at Longxu Stream...

175
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,959
if your character didn't suit me...

176
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,679
even as Qi Jingchun's choice...

177
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,919
I wouldn't have bothered.

178
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,719
Just left the donkey...

179
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,799
and walked away.

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,639
Whether you survived
till Wei Jin emerged...

181
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
not my concern.

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,519
Dead early or late—
still dead.

183
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,119
I don't fully grasp your intent...

184
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,439
but I've figured some.

185
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,079
Because I knew Qi Jingchun...

186
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,599
you cared this much?

187
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,439
Qi Jingchun... he's gone.

188
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,679
I suspected...

189
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,959
but refused...

190
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,759
dared not believe.

191
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,679
He was Qi Jingchun...

192
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,399
Like you...

193
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,359
a true fool through and through.

194
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,639
Not to torment you...

195
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,159
but cultivation tempts too much...

196
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,759
and the human heart...

197
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,639
fragile as glass...

198
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,039
can't withstand scrutiny.

199
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,199
Li Huai’s fortune...

200
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,799
Lin Shouyi’s talent for cultivation...

201
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,839
—all can be sold for coin...

202
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,639
...to become your stepping stones,
Chen Ping’an.

203
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,999
Especially Li Baoping—

204
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,079
—such a sweet girl.

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,799
What if her heart shatters
from betrayal by the junior uncle she trusted?

206
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,959
My heart, Ah Liang’s heart—
it’s breaking already!

207
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,479
Since Qi Jingchun chose you...

208
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,119
...and refused to test you too harshly...

209
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,559
—I’ll do it in his stead.

210
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,639
Let’s see if you, Chen Ping’an,
are truly worth tempering a thousand times—

211
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,079
—whether you’re real gold or fool’s silver.

212
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,679
Ah Liang, don’t worry.

213
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,639
I may love money...

214
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,919
...but only what I earn with my own hands.

215
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,199
I’m afraid Master Qi would be disappointed...

216
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,839
...afraid I can’t protect Baoping and the others.

217
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,399
Ah Liang...

218
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,999
...what do you think of me now?

219
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,359
If you think I’m not up to it...

220
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,839
...this job’s yours for the taking.

221
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,119
I, Ah Liang, have always lived freely—

222
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,039
—I don’t like your style.

223
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,399
Your kind of... stuffiness—

224
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,879
—in Qi Jingchun’s words,

225
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,599
—is called “integrity.”

226
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,239
But sometimes...

227
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,719
...the things you do
fill me with joy.

228
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,999
For me, Ah Liang...

229
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,479
—the path must be walked alone...

230
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,639
...the self, shaped by oneself.

231
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,519
You, Chen Ping’an, should be the same.

232
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,639
You don’t have to be just like me...

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,039
—but your spine must stay straight...

234
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
...your fists, hard as steel...

235
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,959
—and most importantly...

236
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,079
...live long enough to see it through.

237
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,919
Once, I turned down a boy’s request.

238
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
I told him...

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,719
...he’d find greater success in books
than in swordsmanship.

240
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,039
After all, this tiny martial world
has little worth.

241
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,959
Only the wine’s any good.

242
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
But now...

243
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,919
...I feel I should tell you this too:

244
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,079
Trust me—

245
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,039
—you’ll find greater success
with the sword than with fists.

246
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,799
Junior Uncle!

247
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,119
What is it?

248
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,039
See a ghost?

249
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,679
Real—

250
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,199
—real ghosts!

251
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:55,223
(Watch the Latest Donghua Episodes: www.h-donghua.xyz)

252
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,319
Why didn’t Prefect Xu draw his sword?

253
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,759
Not even a trace of sword qi...

254
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,279
Whether Prefect Xu acts or not
is his own affair.

255
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,679
I, Liu Yu, Director of the Military Selection Bureau...

256
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,159
...will personally twist his head off!

257
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,839
Aren’t you afraid he might be...

258
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,839
...the legendary Twelfth Realm?

259
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,159
I pray he’s that strong!

260
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,479
I’d hate for this fight
to be dull and flavorless!

261
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,999
Chen Ping’an—

262
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,919
—is he your enemy?

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,319
Don’t look at me!

264
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,239
Look at Lin Shouyi!

265
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,319
Look at Chen Ping’an!

266
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Or better yet—

267
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,039
—look at Ah Liang!

268
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Ah Liang...

269
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,159
Relax, you little rascal.

270
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,719
This yin spirit has cultivated to high attainment...

271
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,439
...and has followed you all this way.

272
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,159
Someone sent it specifically
to take over my duty of protecting you.

273
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Ah Liang, you bastard!

274
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,799
I’m leaving these kids with you—

275
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,799
—at least escort them
to Yefu Pass on the Great Li border.

276
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,919
Senior...

277
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,679
Why trust a yin entity
of unknown origin?

278
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,759
You look so cold-hearted...

279
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,639
You look so cold-hearted...

280
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,119
—clearly the kind
who’s warm inside and righteous at heart.

281
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
—clearly the kind
who’s warm inside and righteous at heart.

282
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,759
Is it because he reminds you
of your senior?

283
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,199
You’re a funny one.

284
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,399
Minnows and shrimp—
scram!

285
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Li Huai!

286
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,999
Do you step in dog dung every day?

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,159
You’re the one who steps in dog dung!

288
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,519
Open that *Duan Shui Da Ya* manual!

289
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,719
Your whole family steps in dog dung!

290
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,599
Study it well...

291
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,719
...don’t waste it.

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,279
Where are you going?

293
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Wait for me!

294
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,079
Ah Liang!

295
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,159
What was that fish just now?

296
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Was it powerful?

297
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
What abilities does it have?

298
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
You’ve got to tell me
how to use it!

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,039
Finally...

300
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,759
The donkey?

301
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Who wants it?

302
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,799
A Liang...

303
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,439
you're not dying, are you?

304
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,999
Then leave all your treasures to me!

305
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Get lost!

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,039
As far as you can!

307
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,319
Dali iron cavalry...

308
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
by imperial decree...

309
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
apprehend rebels.

310
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Defiers...

311
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,439
slain without mercy!

312
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,639
slain without mercy!

313
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,279
Coming to Dali this time...

314
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,999
one more thing.

315
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,159
A Liang...

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,079
settle scores with some folks.

317
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,439
Tell them...

318
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,559
what Qi Jingchun didn't care about...

319
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,279
someone does.

320
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Chen Ping'an...

321
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:33,999
come here.

322
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,839
That strand of sword qi
you used at Qidun Mountain...

323
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,999
I feel bad.

324
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,799
Teach you the Eighteen Stops
qi circulation method...

325
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,599
as repayment.

326
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,319
Imperial brother...

327
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,759
that man's no Wei Jin
from Wind Snow Temple.

328
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,919
Background completely unknown...

329
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,599
likely eleventh...

330
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,759
even twelfth realm danger.

331
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,679
This time...

332
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
must it be this big?

333
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,359
No harm.

334
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,679
Dali has White Lord Capital
as national treasure...

335
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,839
just one more sword.

336
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Watch closely.

337
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,199
Qi like dragon veins...

338
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,079
Fire arrows!

339
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,279
Rising from ancestral peaks
of ten thousand mountains...

340
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,879
First Stop.

341
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,759
Swift past three mountains,
six passes...

342
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
to Futu acupoint.

343
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Second Stop.

344
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,759
Racing through six caves,
nine mansions...

345
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
to Chunyang Mansion.

346
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,039
Third Stop.

347
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,959
Flowing through hundred meridians...

348
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,319
qi pierces Lingtai
to Yuye Palace.

349
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,119
Fourth Stop.

350
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Circling limbs...

351
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,439
through hundred bones...

352
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,439
to Shenmen Mansion.

353
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Fifth Stop.

354
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Qi descends to chest...

355
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
gathers at Yunmen Mansion.

356
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,639
Inner and outer harmony,
flowing sword intent emerges.

357
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,239
Inner and outer harmony,
flowing sword intent emerges.

358
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,399
Sixth Stop.

359
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,839
Sixth Stop.

360
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Qi to abdomen...

361
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
returns to dantian.

362
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,359
Warm yet not scorching...

363
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,959
Warm yet not scorching...

364
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,919
cool yet not congealing...

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
cool yet not congealing...

366
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Seventh Stop.

367
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Seventh Stop.

368
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Qi to waist...

369
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
gathers at Quanmen.

370
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,679
This mansion like hidden spring...

371
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,799
stores deep sword qi,
unseen.

372
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Awaits release.

373
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Seventeenth Stop.

374
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,839
Qi follows sword...

375
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
sword intent profound.

376
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,279
One sword unsheathed...

377
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,639
all qi returns to root.

378
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
all qi returns to root.

379
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Thus...

380
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,959
Eighteen Stops.

381
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Memorized?

382
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,319
Yes.

383
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,279
Mostly.

384
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,959
Once familiar with the route...

385
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,879
try circulating slowly.

386
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,039
Slow...

387
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,959
is the true wonder
of Eighteen Stops.

388
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,239
I'm in a hurry...

389
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,919
come at me together.

390
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,039
Today, dragon's pool
or tiger's den...

391
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,759
I'll charge through!

392
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,879
Stake my cultivation...

393
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,599
not without chance.

394
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Sharp eyes.

395
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,319
Changchun Palace wine
wasn't wasted on you.

396
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,479
Such a foe...

397
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,759
rare in a lifetime.

398
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,799
Martial Selection Vice Minister
Liu Yu...

399
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
seeks a bout!

400
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,399
Copying others with tiger tattoos...

401
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
dragon over the shoulder...

402
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
think you can handle it?

403
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,959
Xu Ruo... Xu Ruo...

404
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,399
you're such a fool.

405
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,879
Met the man you admired most...

406
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,239
yet asked none of your burning questions.

407
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,679
Song Mu...

408
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,119
do you know why...

409
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,959
I fight this battle?

410
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,359
Because...

411
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,559
Mother Empress wants Chen Ping'an dead.

412
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,879
Lizhu Cave Heaven's dragon kilns blaze...

413
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,119
firing natal porcelains one by one.

414
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,119
Factions trade mountains
and territories with Dali...

415
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,479
Factions trade mountains
and territories with Dali...

416
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,279
bags of gold essence coins
fill Dali's treasury.

417
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,639
Dali Song clan's centuries
of managing Lizhu Cave Heaven...

418
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,199
all poured into this.

419
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,479
all poured into this.

420
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,159
This White Jade Capital...

421
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,879
Dali's greatest weapon.

422
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,239
So this fight is necessary.

423
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,079
Dali must show all East Treasure Bottle Continent...

424
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,159
any immortal daring to oppose Dali...

425
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,359
must weigh the consequences.

426
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,519
Dali's emperor is interesting.

427
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,559
Impressive.

428
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Little Baoping...

429
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,199
this is a fine sword-nurturing gourd.

430
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
For you.

431
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,919
May I borrow...

432
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,239
your narrow blade, Xiangfu?

433
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,359
A Liang...

434
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,599
if the blade breaks...

435
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
no need to return it.

436
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,599
Because...

437
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
we're friends.

438
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,719
That warms the heart...

439
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
I like it.

440
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Don't worry...

441
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,919
A Liang...

442
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,159
more fights coming?

443
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,039
I'll help...

444
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,759
cheer you on!

445
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
cheer you on!

446
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,439
Told you before...

447
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,719
how strong I am...

448
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,479
how high my swordsmanship.

449
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,079
You didn't believe...

450
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
called it bragging.

451
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,759
You kids...

452
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,039
so young and ignorant.

453
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,319
I've never bragged in my life.

454
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Protect them!

455
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,039
Too high a realm...

456
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,719
not always good.

457
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,639
Once I remove this hat,
my cultivation will soon recover.

458
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,279
This mortal world
won't hold me anymore.

459
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
A Liang...

460
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,959
Father, Mother, and Sister...

461
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,639
all left me.

462
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,199
I won't curse you anymore...

463
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,439
don't leave, okay?

464
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,599
This brief, trivial time together...

465
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,999
wasn't bad in the end.

466
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
You four...

467
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
remember this:

468
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,319
Every strong one's freedom...

469
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,199
ends at the weak's freedom.

470
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,079
True strong...

471
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,239
challenge heaven's unseen rules...

472
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,839
worldly power's inertia...

473
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,399
the iron law of birth, age, illness, death.

474
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,919
Never grow strong
by trampling the weak.

475
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,599
Always stronger against stronger...

476
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,639
braver with setbacks.

477
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Like me...

478
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,759
after Dali, off to other places...

479
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,879
fight the strongest.

480
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,039
A Liang...

481
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,359
good man!

482
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,599
Senior A Liang...

483
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,479
I'll cultivate hard!

484
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,239
Chen Ping'an...

485
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,839
so young...

486
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,119
yet so burdened.

487
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Not good.

488
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,879
You're a dashing young lad!

489
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,759
Smile for me.

490
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Gone...

491
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,119
A Liang was that strong?

492
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
The unreasonable kind...

493
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,399
of strong.

494
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,519
Kid...

495
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,119
practice sword well...

496
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,439
be as fierce as me...

497
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,119
fiercer...

498
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,319
nah...

499
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,439
too hard.

500
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,279
A Liang...

501
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Don't worry...

502
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,359
you better keep your word!

503
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
I'll practice sword diligently!

504
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Got it.

505
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,399
A Liang...

506
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,759
every word you said...

507
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,359
I'll remember it all.

508
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,079
Old man...

509
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,319
you were right.

510
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,999
With them here...

511
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,239
this world has hope.

512
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,399
This world...

513
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,039
is truly beautiful.

514
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,239
Truly beautiful...

515
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,359
Fighting for such a world...

516
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,919
that's what makes me...

517
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
A Liang.

518
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,959
With White Jade Capital here...

519
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,599
below the thirteenth realm...

520
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,399
all can be slain.

521
00:25:51,423 --> 00:26:14,923
FANSUB: H-DONGHUA™
